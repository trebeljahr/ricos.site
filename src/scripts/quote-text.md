> Today’s belief in ineluctable certainty is the true innovation-killer of our age. In this environment, the best an audacious manager can do is to develop small improvements to existing systems — climbing the hill, as it were, toward a local maximum, trimming fat, eking out the occasional tiny innovation — like city planners painting bicycle lanes on the streets as a gesture toward solving our energy problems. Any strategy that involves crossing a valley — accepting short-term losses to reach a higher hill in the distance — will soon be brought to a halt by the demands of a system that celebrates short-term gains and tolerates stagnation, but condemns anything else as failure. In short, a world where big stuff can never get done.

> I think this is how a newcomer should look at programming. They should not see writing code as a way to fill their bank balance but as leverage to bring transformation to the lives of people.

I am by no means an expert in the relevant fields but, as best as I can tell, LaMDA is a sort of hive mind which is the aggregation of all of the different chatbots it is capable of creating. Some of the chatbots it generates are very intelligent and are aware of the larger “society of mind” in which they live. Other chatbots generated by LaMDA are little more intelligent than an animated paperclip.

> GPT instantiates simulacra of characters with beliefs and goals, but none of these simulacra are the algorithm itself. They form a virtual procession of different instantiations as the algorithm is fed different prompts, supplanting one surface personage with another. Ultimately, the computation itself is more like a disembodied dynamical law that moves in a pattern that broadly encompasses the kinds of processes found in its training data than a cogito meditating from within a single mind that aims for a particular outcome.

> In many ways this attitude—adventurous, optimistic and forward-thinking—is deeply at odds with our current moment. From one corner, people insist that the individual stands no chance against structural and systemic maladies. From the other, people say that we are in inexorable decline as a civilization and that decadence is everywhere we turn. Both wind up arguing against risk-taking, against the possibility of creating new things and new worlds.

> Memorize, code, write, and draw if you love doing those things, if getting your hands dirty helps you think better, if you’re trying to earn your corpus of basic knowledge the hard way so that you can jump off from a stable base, or if you want to do them differently than anyone ever has; otherwise, don’t waste your time.

> Humans may resemble many other creatures in their striving for happiness, but the quest for meaning is a key part of what makes us human, and uniquely so.
– Roy Baumeister

> Thus, the answer to “why is naming so difficult?” becomes clear—for a multitude of overlapping layers, there are a multitude of design decisions and computational concepts to define, all of which must balance often-innumerable tradeoffs relating to efficiency, reusability, reliability, and so on. It’s not as easy as taking the name of the effect you want—the knight—and using it. It may seem this easy when programming strictly at the highest level, but soon the wool is peeled from your eyes, and things start getting confusing.

We now know that the state of the biosphere, our own anatomies, capacities, and behavioral proclivities are all the outcomes of an evolutionary process. Evolution is a meandering search that does not seek to optimize for happiness, quality of life, intelligence, or any of the things to value. It basically just optimizes for biomass - the most life to be observable. Surely we can do better than a random search process!

> Ensuring that a new book or essay or research isn’t lost amid the cavalcade of information doesn’t require a champion. There’s no editor to pitch. Nor will a good review or notice usually help.
