<p>{description}</p>

Working only 3 days per week is enough to sustain myself and so I try to keep the rest of my time free. Free for traveling, working on my personal projects, such as this website, meeting friends and generally enjoying life. 

I also write a bi-weekly newsletter, called Live and Learn, where I share what I have read and found awesome in the past two weeks. Mostly this is about AI, but not always. 

Currently I am reading Carlo Rovelli's The Order of Time. You can find what I have read, most of it with notes at the [booknotes section of this page](/booknotes).
