While assembling my needlestack I noticed a peculiar thing - most of the video content I had spent hours consuming to feed my brain, left almost no trace of their contents in my mind. I could roughly give a description of what they were about, but to actually remember the detailed, intricate stories and arguments was simply beyond me. This is a huge problem, because it essentially means I have wasted *a lot* of my time watching these things. 

**Problem:** 
We waste time when we consume content for information, if we aren't able to retrieve that information again. 

This article is about how we can solve this problem and it's going to introduce one particular technique for note taking while doing so.

## Enter - the Feynman Technique 

Richard Feynman was a famous, nobel prize winning physicist who advocated understanding over rote memorization. He excelled at diving deep into fields foreign to his pursuits in physics and really questioned the heck out of the authoritative views held in those fields. Venturing into biology, biochemistry, drawing, playing bongos or lockpicking with this attitude made him quite the character and you should definitely read his biography - [Surely You Are Joking Mr. Feynman](#TODO). I also have [book notes on it](#TODO) if you are interested in my thoughts on it.

So, when he approached new subjects he didn't know anything about, he would try to understand them on his own terms. This meant that he would try to ditch the common jargon (which are just complicated names for things) and would instead boil down the truly important concepts behind those names into simple words and language. Then he would try to write down those concepts, laying them out on paper, as if trying to write a textbook that explains the topic to a young child. This approach is now known as Feynman Note Taking. 

The main thing that makes taking notes like this effective is that you have to interact and grapple with the content you are consuming - be that books, lectures, podcasts, videos or even real life conversations. And while you grapple and put it into your own words and simplify it for understanding, you build connections that make these concepts stick in your brain a lot better. You also expose flaws in understanding you might otherwise gloss over, because you can't simplify them enough. There will be a bump you hit, when you encounter parts you don't quite get yet. 

And best of all - you leave a papertrail of notes behind, that you can go and look back at, to refresh your memories. 

## The Idea of Feynman Noting Everything

We already established that consuming informational content without understanding it is wasting time. The solution is simple yet hard. It's to write Feynman Notes on *everything that you consume*. If you watch or read anything for information, and you didn't write Feynman notes for it, chances are you won't really understand and memorize it.

Especially watching videos is something that is not "work" in the sense that I can shut down my brain and not actively engage with what I am "learning" and simply let it drizzle over me, without really paying attention to it. And the worst part - I can even justify this waste of time to myself because I am "learning" something. Even though the brutal honest truth is that I am not learning anything whatsoever. 

Consuming educational content without grappling with it feels like learning, but it really isn't.

Hence - let's Feynman note everything. Even just the thought of this idea seems a little weird. Something in my mind rebels against the thought, because I can smell the extra cognitive work that would be added by an appraoch like this from a mile away and my brain really doesn't like the thought of that extra work. I want to lie down in bed, watching videos all day long, not sit beside my laptop, taking notes after watching, *thinking* about the content I just watched, going over it again, disecting it, making sure that I really understood and am able to coherently explain what I just watched to others. 

But one thing I notice over and over and over again, is that this feeling in my mind this sort of aversion towards work is the best indicator I have built in to what is something good and worthwhile to pursue. [It's like I know what is the right thing to do, by kind of not wanting to do it](#TODO). Feynman Note taking everything definitely falls square into that category. 

## Another Advantage

There is one last advantage of this process of digesting information - the papertrail you leave behind. Even though note taking has been shown to be better for memory if done by hand instead of on a computer I think that for Feynman Note Taking, doing things on a computer has another advantage. 

Dissecting content this way produces new content. It's kind of like you are constantly producing chewed on and pre-digested, simplified and personalized versions of the content you are consuming. 

It's like you are constantly turning your stream of educational experience into something more worthwhile, through the process of engaging with it in hard mental work. You turn educational experience into a papertrail of Feynman Notes, clarified pieces of text, without jargon and easy to understand and digest. Kind of the perfect blog post.

And you can even share this digital papertrail with others. It makes for good "content" in and of itself. So not only does it help you understand a topic in detail and helps you remember it more clearly, it kind of doubles as a proof of understanding - establishing some amount of authority on a topic you have spent valuable time learning. This is why I think this process should happen on your computer instead of a physical notebook. 

## Conclusion 

So this is at least the idea of writing down everything into Feynman Notes - once I have executed it for a while I will put up a second post to detail how it went and link to it from here as well. There are a few things I am still thinking about how to best do it: 

**Work in Progress Questions:**

How to best organize the Feynman notes. 
- Should I write them by topic? Synthesizing over different pieces of content 
- Or should I write them by piece of content and then group them with tags/categories?

- How should I handle quotations, copyright, source work etc.
- How can I make sure to avoid blindly copying things, without understanding them really?
- How long should the time be between - watching content + writing the Feynman Notes?
