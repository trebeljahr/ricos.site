<p>{description}</p>

Right now I am not working on anything "professionally", instead I spend most of my time working on my personal projects, such as this website.  

I write a bi-weekly newsletter, called Live and Learn, where I share what I have read and found awesome in the past two weeks. The newsletter is mostly about AI and other interesting things that I found on the internet. 

Currently I am reading Alan Watts Still the Mind. You can find what I have read, most of it with notes at the [booknotes section of this page](/booknotes).
