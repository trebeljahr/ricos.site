excerpt: "One of my favorite books of all time. I grew up reading Michael Ende, but this is one of the books, which changes it's meaning as you grow up. It's about appreciating the small, but important things in life. Savouring the moments, and not forgetting, for the sake of time and efficiency, what it means to be alive."

## Summary

<p>{excerpt}</p>

It's about staying a child internally, about acknowledging and *making time* for the wonders that this world has to offer. And these life lessons are embedded in a heartwrenchingly beautiful story, written in some of the most beautiful prose you can find in a novel. Michael Ende's Momo is truly something special.
