excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. With AI development picking up speed, it feels like new things are happening every day. I sometimes think that writing this newsletter only once every two weeks is not enough to catch up with all the awesome stuff that is happening. This edition will focus on AGI and the discussion that has ensued after ChatGPT Plugins and GPT-4 have been shown to the public."

[**Open Letter** by the Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/). There are a lot of people who want to stop further progress on bigger and more powerful AI models for at least 6 months, so that we have enough time to learn and understand *how* they work and *why* these big LLTMs generalize so well. They argue that we need more understanding to judge the safety of these models and not accidentally produce a genie that can't be put back into the bottle. They claim the point where AGI is close enough that things can quickly become an existential risk is now. We should proceed with the utmost caution.

[**Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence** by Microsoft Research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf). A paper that is well worth reading. A short excerpt from the abstract: "Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system." I think this shows that the people who signed the Future of Life Institute's Open Letter are right to worry about even larger models. Larger models make unexpected jumps in thinking and reasoning capabilities, and maybe there is a threshold after which, "true" AGI emerges all of a sudden. 

[**ChatGPT Plugins** by Open AI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins). In a nutshell, OpenAI just released a way to give their GPT-4 model ~~super-powers~~. Uhm I mean access to real-world integrations, so that it not only can tell you how to do tasks but do them "itself". This gives me the creeps. To think about an intelligent algorithm, that is writing source code, executing it without proper supervision, as well as being able to use a browser, do Zapier integrations and so much more. For now, the set of plugins is very limited, but in the future, any work on a computer can be completely automated, as long as you can describe it in English language.

[**Attention is all You Need** by Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/attention-is-all-you-need). One heck of an idea. It details how ChatGPT plugins are a building block for the perfect business model of OpenAI. ChatGPT already is a central place people go to, to work more effectively. Because of that it has the attention of many people. This attention makes it useful for companies searching for customers. Eventually, integrating with ChatGPT becomes a necessity because that's where most of their potential users are. The companies who do offer ChatGPT integration will survive, those who don't will not. And the plugins these companies design and build will in turn increase the usefulness of ChatGPT even further. Which in turn will grow it's userbase and so on. Until eventually ChatGPT becomes the ultimate tool for everything you would ever need or want to do on a computer. 

[**AutoGPT** by Torantulino](https://github.com/torantulino/auto-gpt). The logical continuation of the HustleGPT idea from a tweet I shared in the last newsletter. This is a github repo that is trying to fully automate business generation with GPT-4. The idea is to let GPT-4 prompt itself over and over again and give it the possibity to inspect it's own code and ideas in Python. It's still broken in complex scenarios, but even the thought of this *ever* working is uhm... *interesting*. And this doesn't even use the ChatGPT plugins mentioned earlier.

[**AI video generation - Gen2** by Runway](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2). This is insane. We will soon have full-feature films being created by a single person and a tool like this. WTF. Even creative jobs like those of movie directors and actors will change dramatically in the future. Think about a "Will Smith" or "Jennifer Lawrence" AI plugin you could buy to have an AI generate films of your ideas, but "acted" by the digital copies of their real life counterparts. And then maybe tell the AI that the film should look like it was directed by say Steven Spielberg. And you get a crazy world, where movies can be created by everybody who has an idea and the ability to express it in English. All the while ChatGPT has automated everything happening on computers, while GPT-5 is being researched as the starting point for the singularity. The next few years will be a fun rollercoaster. 

[**Solugen** by Elliot Hershberg](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/solugen). This blog post introduces the biotech company Solugen. It pales a little bit in comparison to the craziness of the AI world but I still wanted to include it in here. Solugen is a crazy innovation hub, building the future of chemical manufacturing, right now. They are using biological enzymes within a "bio factory", to produce many of the chemicals needed for our everyday products. However, they do so way cheaper and carbon-free, because they pull the carbon necessary for the chemicals out of the CO2 from the air. This is nothing short of revolutionary. It seems like magic now, but soon bio factories like the ones Solugen is building will be commonplace and manufacture everything, from clothes to rocketfuel.
