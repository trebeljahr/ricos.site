excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time Google has announced that their AI can solve mathematical olympiad problems, Prophetic AI is trying to induce lucid dreaming states with AI, and Javier Milei's speech went wild on the internet, with an AI dubbed version being even better. As always I hope that you enjoy this edition of Live and Learn."

> I‚Äôve tried blanketing myself in books. Eventually they saturate my mind; the soggy attention not letting in one more grain of sugar; one more grain of someone else‚Äôs thoughts. Other peoples‚Äô thoughts are a kind of sedative‚Äîthey‚Äôve already done the hard work of thinking them.

[**Alpha Geometry** by Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry). It feels like AI is getting closer and closer to human-level reasoning with every passing week. In this work done by the Deepmind team, they use a combination of symbolic reasoning and LLMs to create plans to analyze and solve geometrical mathematical olympiad problems. The resulting model is on par with human performance in Math Olympiads. This is crazy. It's an AI that can *reason* and has something like a *thought process*.   

[**Morpheus 1** by Prophetic AI](https://twitter.com/PropheticAI/status/1750534355242418300). Some of the craziest stuff I've seen in a while. Prophetic AI is trying to read brainwaves, then parse them with a neural network, and finally emit ultrasonic waves to induce lucid dreaming states in people. It's quite "out there" in terms of what people do with AI, and it gives a glimpse into things to come. Things that we might eventually think of as normal: things such as AI-enhanced, dreamlike conscious experiences.

[**Javier Milei's AI dubbed speech**](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1747870867902926899). The beautiful side of the deepfake technology that I covered in the last newsletter is that you can also use it to create dubs that preserve the accent of the speaker and *feel* natural. This speech given at the World Economic Forum went viral and I listened to it in Spanish with English subtitles first, but this version, generated with [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/), is *much* better. It seems surreal that you can soon watch any content in any language you want, while also preserving the voices and mannerisms of speech of the original. 

[**Solugen** by Jeff Burke](https://jeffburke.substack.com/p/solugen-the-first-carbon-negative). A wonderful article detailing how Solugen aims to create all sorts of petrochemicals at a fraction of the current costs by using advanced biochemistry. They are creating enzyme factories to quickly catalyze and drive petrochemical reactions at much lower temperatures and pressures. This reduces the amount of waste and dangerous chemicals that need to be used as well as CO2 released into the atmosphere during the process tremendously. It's essentially plant syrup + water + energy in and plastics and solvents etc. out, with no dangerous waste as byproducts.

## üåå Traveling üåå

I'm still hitchhiking around on boats and am right now in Cape Verde, planning to cross the Atlantic. There's a lovely dog on the boat I'm currently on. She's a bit scared of the ocean, but after a few days out at sea getting used to it. And I am using Star Link to write this. A stable Internet connection while out at sea, miles away from the land is something truly futuristic and it feels magical.
