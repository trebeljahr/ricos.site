In September I finished my first [1-month project](/1-month-projects). During the process I learned a lot of little things and this post is a re-collection and documentation of these learnings. You can check out what I've built at [fractal.garden](https://fractal.garden). 

### Learnings

### Marketing

Plan for "marketing" work. Putting your stuff *out there* is as important as building it, and making good posts for HackerNews, Twitter, LinkedIn and co. takes work. But it is necessary to gain traction and therefore worth the effort. Without doing it, the projects will never be appreciated by enough people, to make them worth the effort. For the next 1-months projects I want to dedicate at least 3-4 days of the month to only marketing efforts. This includes reaching out to other blogs and going to Meetups to showcase what I've built. 

On the same note, I found out that marketing efforts are very very painful to me. I really dislike putting things *out there*. It's weird, since I *love* showing the things I have built to my friends and get a real kick of happiness and dopamine from that. 

But maybe I am afraid of failing openly. There is a sense of shame, in publicizing my own stuff so heavily, knowing how flawed it still is because it was *only* a month long projects. But then that's also an excuse. When my stuff is visible in the open, and people find all the things that are wrong with it, that just really really stings. And even though this is something completely irrational and I know that this is the case, the feeling remains, this bitter taste of "hmm. I don't really want to do this", and this very feeling, at least for me, leads to procrastination. I shy away from these pains, and hence I don't improve my work with the valuable feedback I could gain from this exchange and don't put as much of my work *out there* as I could. [This is an obstacle to be overcome](/posts/fundamental-problems).

### Relinquishing Control

When creating a new open source project, it's (at least for me) kind of hard to let go. In a way this site fractal.garden feels like "my" site, and by making it open source and inviting others to contribute to it, I am relinquishing some of that control. And somehow that feels bad. There is a voice in my head that says: Hey. Wouldn't it be cool, to fix these things *on your own*? You should really implement *this* yourself. *You know* how it would work... Do it. But this is not the idea of 1-month projects. They shouldn't start stretching out into 2 months or 3 months, because then the whole idea of exploring things for the sake of exploration is completely lost.

### Imperfections

Living with the imperfections from the projects and moving on still remains really really tough for me though. There are a bunch of little things that I would still like to fix with the fractal.garden (mostly about mobile/cross browser support), and I've created issues for them on the project's GitHub, but I have to *restrain* myself from actually fixing them, because I want to spend my time doing other things. And this is really really tough for me. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the time to fix it, because I want to spend my time on the next 1-month project.

### Timeframe

1-month might not be the correct amount of time *for me*. One thing I noticed is that 1-month is a weird amount of time. It's too long and too short at the same time. The final state of the projects is such that they still need work and there are a lot of threads left open that I would like to follow. There is a bunch of cleaning up tasks still to do. There is still quality improvements to be made. There are features still to be built etc. one month is not enough time for tackling all of this.

*But* â€“ one month is too long at the very same time. I notice that I start to lose interest in things very very quickly, my time for being hyper motivated and focused on a project is around one to two weeks maximum. After that, I start to grow tired of it, and my brain searches for other things to latch on and procrastinate with. One thing I procrastinated this month with a lot, was to use Midjourney to produce a digital art portfolio. 

This problem was made worse, because I had a split focus, two goals I wanted to reach. Two goals that in conflict with each other. Building the website for the fractal.garden as well as pushing myself to build a newsletter for this site. I accomplished both, but the final quality of the fractal.garden projects was jeopardized in the process. 

### Working Habits

I learned, that I can work really hard and self-motivated. And not procrastinate too much. I also found out that at least for me time tracking helps quite well (I use [clockify](https://clockify.me/) and their [chrome extension](https://clockify.me/chrome-time-tracking) at the moment). Since using it I've become a lot better at staying on track, and there is something really rewarding of having a time sheet at the end of the week showing just, *how much* effort I've *exactly* put into something. For the Fractal Garden I spent around 65 tracked hours making it. Sometimes I still forget to turn the timer on, and at the beginning of the month, I didn't use the time tracking method either. So yeah, things to improve in the future ^^. Also that number seems a little on the low end for a full month of work, it should be closer to something like 100+ hours (25 hours per week?) if a project is really sufficiently focused on. This is something that I would like to push for over the next months. The accountability of [the process](/posts/the-process) that Marc and I set up, helps a lot as well. 

### Technical Challenges

Technical Challenges: WebGL and learning about shaders.

Design, and how much I suck at it. Luckily there is lawsofux and I just copied some of their design because it looks so good. 

A lot of work is rework. You do something, then you find out, hmm, I should do it this way instead, because I really want feature X, or run into a bug that was unanticipated. For this particular project of the Fractal Garden two big things and refactors come to my mind.

### Facts about Fractals

How the Chaos Game works

How L-Systems work

How  IFS's work

That many fractals have infinite length and 0 area or some other crazy properties like it 

How connected Fractals really are with each other.
