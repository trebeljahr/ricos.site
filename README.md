# trebeljahr - a blog of a curious person

This is the repository from which the blog at [trebeljahr.com](trebeljahr.com) is being built. The blog is built on Next.js, which generates static webpages from Markdonw, which are then served via Vercel. This enables a blazing fast website, hosted completely for free. 

The blog covers topics like personal improvement, nutrition, the workings of computers, brains and cells, programming related advice, music, traveling, photography and more. In the future I am planning to build tags into it and organize the posts under those tags in a searchable manner. I am also adding a read more section as but the main purpose is to get myself to publish something online regularly. 

I want to commit to writing for this blog, every day of the week, every week, publishing something whenever I feel it is ready. That is the whole goal of this exercise. 

Maybe not the whole goal... Ideally it should also serve as a website that showes who I am. What I think and read or have read. It should aggregate my learnigns and life lessons in a readable form and help me organize my thoughts and serve as a reminder to myself. Of what I want to do and where I want to go. Furthermore it might one day be a valuable resource to other people besides myself. 

But that would be an added benefit not the main goal behind writing it.
