excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time with crazy breakthroughs in the field of robotics from different teams, another LK-99 related possible super conductor paper, and people warning about the beginnings of the post truth era with deepfakes generated by AI becoming so easy to create it's not even funny anymore."

> Exceptional people working together is the closest thing we have to a philosopher‚Äôs stone. Great teams are akin to true alchemy‚Äîcreating something from nothing. Fight for them. It‚Äôs always worth it.

[**Mobile Aloha** by Stanford University](https://mobile-aloha.github.io/). The demos for this have made the rounds on X the last week or so, because they essentially build robots that can mimic human tasks in a kitchen with surprising accuracy by learning through a tele-operation process. The crazy thing is that it's running on a normal laptop with relatively easily reproducible and available hardware, meaning that this is possible to build on your own in your garage. The code can be [found here on the Mobile Aloha Github](https://github.com/MarkFzp/mobile-aloha).

[**Googles Advanced Robotics Projects** by Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/shaping-the-future-of-advanced-robotics). Google is creating several spin off papers based on their RT-2 architecture, helping to train further models better. This includes things like [learning tasks from trajectories](https://rt-trajectory.github.io/), ways to use vision and LLMs to essentially ["auto train" to new scenarios](https://auto-rt.github.io/) and [customizing transformer based architectures for use in robotics](https://sites.google.com/view/rtsara). 

[**LK-99 reloaded? *Another* Possible Meissner Effect Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00999.pdf). Now the internet is less hyped and more sad to be let down *again*, yet there is some hope and optimism by some people. The [prediction markets are grim](https://manifold.markets/postjawline/will-the-meissner-effect-be-confirm), with people collectively thinking that there is only a 3% chance for it being reproduced this time around. 

[**Post Truth Era** by Ethan Mollick and Others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=9EIsGra80_I). These sorts of demos are easily possible to create now. There's [another one by Martin Nebelong](https://twitter.com/MartinNebelong/status/1745879162852688322) an AI artist creator on X. They use tools like [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/) and [Dubbing for Everyone](https://dubbingforeveryone.github.io/) (also watch their [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnlWVLLoeiY)) to create these sorts of videos and it freaks me out. The level of skill and material required to do ultra convincing deep fakes shrinks with every passing week and it is basically impossible to tell real from fake videos at this point, especially if only looking at them at a glance while browsing the internet. As both Ethan Mollick and Martin Nebelong point out, now is the time to agree on a "passphrase" to be used to identify yourself with loved ones in correspondence such as email. Another paper that caught my attention on this same topic is [Spear Phishing With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2305/2305.06972.pdf) that desribes tactics and the effectiveness of going "phishing" (i.e. impersonating other persons on the internet for scams)

[**GPT Store** by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store). Since the OpenAI Dev Day people have created over 3 million custom GPTs and now they opened the store so that people can start monetizing them and get financially rewarded for creating GPTs that have higher engagements.

[**Rabbit R1** by Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4). This is a new device, similar to a smartphone that embraces LLMs and the changes and possibilities that they bring to user interfaces and how we interact with computers, similar to what the iPhone did when touchscreens became a serious possibility. The main idea is that with LLMs natural language and cross "app" interoperability for complex tasks will become the new norm. And the Rabbit R1 is designed with that in mind.
