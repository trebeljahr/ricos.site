This is my first newsletter, *ever*. The idea of this newsletter is to send 1 photo (above), 1+ booknote(s), 1+ post(s), 1 status update, 1 song and 1 useful/beautiful/random link. So here we go:

## Booknotes
This month I've read and published booknotes on [High Output Management](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/high-output-management) and [Being You](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/being-you).
I've also reread [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/navalmanack).

## Posts
Somebody else's: [Let's talk about Margins by Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/essays/lets_talk_about_margins/). A beautifully written post on the attention to detail â€“ and the feeling of "good paper". This moved me.

My own: [Morning Meditation](https://trebeljahr.com/posts/morning-meditation)

## Status Update
For most of this month, I've been working on [www.fractal.garden](https://www.fractal.garden). It's been a wild month but the site is slowly coming to fruition (excuse the pun). If looking at beautiful fractal patterns is your thing, then you should 100% check it out!

Roughly 1 week of this month was spent creating this very newsletter and the capabilities to deliver more in the future. I am working on creating a write-up of how I built everything and all the technology behind the effort. Stay tuned!

## Song

## Link
I discovered one of my favorite sites on the internet this very month. 
[Sketchplanations by Jono Hey](https://sketchplanations.com/) are so awesome, I want to buy half of them as prints, simply because they are so beautiful.
