# Richard Feynman, How Sound Works and Ambition ‚Äì Newsletter #5

## ‚ú® Quote ‚ú®

> When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are *merely* a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror.

[Lying by Sam Harris](/booknotes/lying). A very short book. The gist: Lying is bad, don't do it. It goes into some more detail answering the question of *why* lying is bad, exactly. But still. Lying is bad. That's the gist.

[Sound by Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/). What sound really is, how it works, how it's generated and a lot more. All of it explained from first principles with beautiful and interactive demos, going from "this is a box of air", to "that is how pressure works" and eventually ending up at Fourier Transforms, Standing Waves, Spatial Audio, Interference and the Doppler Effect. This is one of the most beautiful sites I have found in a while, because the articles are *all* works of art. Long form, detailed, with beautiful demos. The blog is rivaling WaitButWhy in quality, something I don't say lightly.

[Salamander Timelapse by National Geographic](https://youtu.be/SEejivHRIbE). A hauntingly beautiful timelapse of a salamander growing from a single cell into a full salamander. It makes you wonder about life, and how it works. And how a cell can store all of the information that is necessary to produce the intricate shapes of a complicated organism like a salamander. If you find this interesting, check out the [FAQ of Michael Levin](https://drmichaellevin.org/resources/). He's working hard to find out, how this stuff works.

[Physics Lectures by Richard Feynman](https://open.spotify.com/show/7sMDQbAOJLTby25DfOsu6O?si=h21mXwS8TZO6XiD1rTkmAQ). I knew these lectures were freely available online as a website, but didn't know that there is also an audio version for them on Spotify. If you want to feed your curiosity and learn some physics ‚Äì this is a wonderful place to start. Also check out the [written version](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/).

[How I Ended up Non Ambitious by LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BFamedwSgRdGGKXQQ/how-i-ended-up-non-ambitious). This post gives some perspective. It's deconstructing where ideas and ideals come from, and how to think about who we are, wo we want to be, and why that is the case. LessWrong is, at times, a bit too "overachieving" in tone, so this article was a beautiful contrast. Thinking deeply, about 1. what we want, and 2. why we want it, often helps to clarify things and re-adjust where we want to go. It made me stop and ask myself, do you want to be ambitious? If so, *why*?

[Chip Manufacturing Ecosystem by Steve Blank](https://steveblank.com/2022/01/25/the-semiconductor-ecosystem/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). A detailed article about how the semiconductor industry works. Main takeaway ‚Äì our modern world runs on modern chips. And the tech stack to develop chips is so complicated that companies specialize in single steps of this process. Some only manufacture, others only design, others only build the tools for designing etc. Finally, whoever owns the infrastructure has a huge leverage on political, economical and military power.
