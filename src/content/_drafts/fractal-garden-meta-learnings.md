In September I finished my first [1-month project](/1-month-projects). During the process I learned a lot of little things and this post is a re-collection and documentation of these learnings. You can check out what I've built at [fractal.garden](https://fractal.garden). 

This post has two parts - Part 1, which you are reading now is all about the Meta Learnings, that I gained from this first 1-month project. Things about how to manage time, how to let go from a project and live with the imperfections of it. [Part 2 on the other hand](/posts/fractal-garden-technical-learnings) is all about the technical learnings and problems I encountered. It will contain some code, some mathematics and a lot of links, to all the resources that were used during the creation of the garden.

### Meta Learnings

### Marketing

The biggest learning for me was that, you should plan time for marketing work. Putting your stuff *out there* is as important as building it, and making good posts for HackerNews, Twitter and LinkedIn takes a lot of work and effort. But this work is necessary to gain traction and therefore it's worth the effort. Without doing it, the projects will never be appreciated by enough people, to make them worth the effort. And they won't grow after my initial one month push is over. For the next 1-months projects I plan to dedicate at least the last 3-4 days of the month to marketing efforts, only. This should include reaching out to other blogs and going to Meetups to showcase what I've built.

On the same note, I found that marketing efforts are for some reason very painful to me. Somehow putting things *out there* feels weird. Not weird... It feels. Well. Bad. Like I don't want to do it... 

Which is confusing to me, since I *love* showing what I have built to my friends and I get a real kick of dopamine from it, while at the same time I heavily dislike putting stuff out there on the internet for a lot of people to see. 

Maybe it's the fear of failing openly that causes those feelings. There is a sense of shame, in publicizing my own work,  knowing how flawed it still is because it was *only* a month long project. When my stuff is visible in the open, and people find all the things that are wrong with it, that just really really stings. 

And even though this is something completely irrational and I know it to be the case, the feeling remains, this bitter taste of "hmm. I don't really want to do this..", and this very feeling leads to procrastination. It's negative weighting on the neurons that produce action and motivation to do something. And therefore the chance of you doing it decreases by a lot.

People just shy away from potential pain, and hence miss the opportunity to improve their work with the valuable feedback they could gain from the open exchange on the internet. And they also don't put as much of their work *out there* as they could. [This, is an obstacle to be overcome](/posts/fundamental-problems).

### Relinquishing Control

When creating a new open source project, it's kind of hard to let go. In a way fractal.garden feels like "my" site, and by making it open source and inviting others to contribute to it, I am relinquishing some of that control. And somehow that feels bad. There is a voice in my head that says: Hey. Wouldn't it be cool, to fix these things *on your own*? You should really implement *this* yourself. *You know* how it would work... Do it. But I try to ignore that voice because this is not the idea of 1-month projects and even less of open sourcing something. 

1-month projects shouldn't start stretching out into 2 months or 3 months, because then the whole idea of exploring things for the sake of exploration is completely lost. 

Also, I need to learn to relinquish that control, so that I can actually work together with other people. There is something deeply beautiful about the process of open source. Somehow a lot of people, freely getting together to create something awesome has a very empowering and noble touch to it. 

And fully acknowledging this feeling is the antidote to not wanting to relinquish control. Once you start to see work from other people pouring in and simply accept "their" work on "your" projects, your ego will start to slowly dissolve away.

And then you can accept that you can't do everything on your own and that's why you made something open-source in the first place. Which means you can let go and relinquish control, to empower other people and let the projects take on a life of their own. As an aside, I think that this is equally important in a company or management setting. This idea that the project itself is more important than *you* are. It's a very powerful idea, but still something that I have a hard time to fully wrap my head around and accept. A sliver of ego still remains. 

### Imperfections

Living with the imperfections from the projects and moving on is really really tough for me. There are a bunch of little things that I would like to fix with the fractal.garden, and I've created issues for them on the [project's GitHub](), but I have to *restrain* myself from actually fixing them, because I want to spend my time doing other things. And this is really really tough for me. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the time to fix it, because I want to spend my time on the next 1-month project.

### Timeframe

1-month might not be the correct amount of time *for me*. One thing I noticed is that 1-month is a "weird" amount of time. It's too long and too short at the same time! 

The final state of the project after one month, is such that it still needs work and there are a lot of threads left open that need follow up. There are still a bunch of cleaning up tasks to do. There are quality improvements to be made still. There are features to still be built etc. 

One month is not enough time for tackling all of those. And that's part of the idea of exploration. But facing this and living with these imperfections, opening them up for fixing from other people, that's what it's about at the end of the day... 

*But* – one month is too long at the very same time. 

I notice that I start to lose interest in things very very quickly, my time for being hyper motivated and focused on a project is around one to two weeks maximum. After that, I start to grow tired of it, and my brain searches for other things to latch on and procrastinate with. One thing I procrastinated this month with a lot, was to use Midjourney to produce a digital art portfolio.

### Working Habits

I learned, that I can work really hard and self-motivated. And not procrastinate too much. I also found out that at least for me, time tracking helps quite well with being more productive (I use [clockify](https://clockify.me/) and their [chrome extension](https://clockify.me/chrome-time-tracking) at the moment). Since using it I've become a lot better at staying on track, and there is something really rewarding of having a time sheet at the end of the week showing just, *how much* effort you have *exactly* put into something. For the Fractal Garden I spent around 65 tracked hours making it. Sometimes I still forget to turn the timer on, and at the beginning of the month, I didn't use the time tracking method at all. So yeah, things to improve in the future ^^. #

Also that number seems a little on the low end for a full month of work, it should be closer to something like 100+ hours (25 hours per week?) if a project is really sufficiently focused on. This is something that I would like to push for over the next months. The accountability of [the process](/posts/the-process) that Marc and I set up, helps a lot as well. 

However there is one thing off with my working habits still: the lack of focus. There is a graspable tension between the 1-month projects and the work that still has to happen – here on trebeljahr.com. Last month it was the newsletter setup, this month it will be some SEO work, the month after some book summaries...

The crux of it is, that the amount of work that can be put into 1-month projects is diminished a lot by the amount of hours spent on working on other things. And this idea is only amplified because of the shifts in my motivation that happen every roughly two weeks or so. 

This is for now, still an unsolved problem... But I know that some of the 1-month projects have no chance of seeing the light of day if I don't fix this, so it's on the back of my mind for the time to come.

### Conclusion

Because this was the first 1-month project, the amount of learning I took from it was tremendous. I don't think there will be that many "meta insights" to write about during the next projects, but let's see. This process, of sitting down after the project and reflecting and putting into words, what I've learned from it, is something that I want to keep either way.
