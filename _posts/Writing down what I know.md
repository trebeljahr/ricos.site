Something that I am playing with as a thought is to write down all of the things that I know and the knowledge that I accumulate in the form of blog posts over my lifetime. For certain topics that I am really passionate about I want to turn this idea into something even more ambitious, namely that I want to write books about the things I am passionate about and about which I am reading tons of stuff. The idea behind those books is nothing much other than presenting a synthesis of the things I read intermingled with my own thoughts. A kind of processed version of the books I have read, that reflects the state of my knowledge and might be interesting to others because my viewpoint is something unique.

Since I am a unique person in the sense that I have read a lot, broadly spanning different topics and genres which have similar ideas that can be connected to each other. Connecting the learnings from those different disciplines, Charlie Munger style, building up synthesis of new knowledge that could otherwise not be had.

Topics that I think I could cover which would be super cool are - nutrition, the workings of the brain, ideas and their powers on the human psyche, technology and how computers actually work... unwrapping layers of complexity, starting with something as low level as transistors and working my way up all the way to higher level programming languages, eventually, operating systems, and web-servers and the way a normal user interacts with a machine, biochemistry and the way things in the body work, how cells do their job and the insides of a cell are complex factory with conveyor belts and logistics problems, power plants and stockpile problems...

So what I think I should do with all of these is make an actual commitment and start. Going back to the idea of writing all those blogs, that I had a few years ago, maybe now is the time to actually put in the hours and write. Write as if my life depended on it. Write and read, as voraciously and as much as I can, while keeping my side projects going, so that I can learn from those things. So that I can digest and write about them.

And I mean why not... In a way writing is a pretty good shot at doing something that is both meaningful and transcendent as well as valuable and therefore rewarding. So maybe that is what I should want to become? A writer? The unique blend between knowledge and making it understandable for others can actually change the world, since it produces and disseminates ideas which in turn influence the behavior of people, which in turn influence the workings of the world. And therefore writing can make an impact that is rather hard to measure, just like the work of a teacher, but that is immense.

The idea of becoming an amplifier rings a bell here, something that Marc told me about, a type of person, that bests spends their time not implementing and building the future themselves, but is better of preparing the next generations for a task like this. By sparking passion, by teaching, by disseminating ideas. The likes of Vsauce, Veritasium, Kurzgesagt as well as blogs like WaitButWhy, SlateStarCodex and LessWrong come to my mind when I think of things like this.

But somehow I am not sure if that would be the right or even a good path for me... Can I be content with producing content, and the value of that content? Or do I have to produce something more tangible, a real product and a whole company that is pushing innovation in an area that is important to me? Also how much of this is actually hybris on my side? Dreams of grandeur of a person, that still lives at home, has no job, no degree, just a thinking brain, a pile of books on his shelf and a lot of (crazy?) ideas?

In the end it probably comes down to a simple question... why not just try it? I mean how bad would it be if I spend something like a year pursuing this opportunity, writing every day, writing down my own knowledge, reading deeply, digesting, trying to build a blog and seeing where this leads me and whether or not it could be the kind of life I would want to live? Is being a content creator something that I can become content with? Even though I myself wouldn't change anything but people's minds in the hope that someday one of those people goes around and does something great...

Enabling other people to do great things, igniting passions, instead of living the passion myself? Stop thinking... just try it. The worst thing that could happen is that I learned somehting about myself and that I have a bunch of articles on a webpage, that nobody ever looks at... Which sounds fine enough. Go do it.
