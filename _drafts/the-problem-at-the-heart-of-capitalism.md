# The Problem at the Heart of Capitalism

I think something is wrong with our world and I have not seen this thought expressed anywhere else in quite that way yet, that's why I sat down to write this blog post. It will be a deep dive, covering lots of different topics, like social media, economics, neuroanatomy, education, AI research and addiction. By the end, you hopefully will understand what I mean when I say that there exists a problem at the "heart" of Capitalism. And the problem is a big one, causing a lot of unnecessary human suffering. So let's at least stop to think about it.

## Capitalism?

First what do I mean when I say "Capitalism"? The word can be widely used and people mean different things. In my mind when I think of capitalism, I think of free trade, between individuals, corporations and countries. I picture an economy where prices rise and fall according to supply and demand and where companies compete with each other freely, "laissez faire" style, without roadblocks put up by the government or other institutions. Everybody can compete for customers. Everybody can try to buy and sell things and try to make a living from it. In such a system, usually the best products win. What best entails here *exactly*  is a good point for debate and not entirely clear. Let's just define "best" products as those that sell the most, which is a usually caused by a unique blend of price, marketing, actual quality, what problem they solve and how they solve it, how hard they are to manufacture, the margins gained by the producers and so on. However the best products, by definition rule in the market, because they are better adapted to getting sold. 

## Isn't Capitalism supposed to be good?

As the story goes, in such a capitalist world, companies are competing to create the "best" products and those companies will create technological progress and prosperity for the society they operate in along the way. I think this part, which goes back to thinkers like Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes and a lot of others, is not the problem. I even think fundamentally this picture of Capitalism is right. Capitalism and free trade are the driving forces behind why our world is in the place it is right now, with prosperity for many of the people in the world and climbing standards of living across all measures across the whole globe. This is something that most people actually don't even believe in, yet is factually true. For a good account of why and how this is true I can only recommend you go and read [The Better Angels of our Nature by Steven Pinker](#TODO).

Yet, while we largely live in such a world, a world governed by free trade, and competing corporations, it's not the heaven that you would hope it would be. Smith's invisible hand (an idea introduced by him in his famous work [On the Wealth of Nations](#TODO)) works wonders, but somewhere along the way it also does quite a few horrible things. What are those things?

## The Symptoms

There are some disturbing trends visible in our world right now:

Our attention spans are shrinking. I personally feel like it's getting increasingly harder for me to do solid focused work. And intellectually demanding feats too often seem impossible to pull off, instead I *chill* and watch YouTube. Even reading a good book for a few hours is not something I regularly do anymore and sometimes it even feels like work to me, like something hard and painful to do, something that I don't really enjoy anymore, something that I don't want to do. Why?

Addictions especially to new formats of media, like porn, TikTok, YouTube, Netflix or games, are a huge problem for almost everybody, at least in my generation. Including me. Why?

There is an obesity pandemic. Ok I am not a part of that yet, because I am young, do a lot of sports and try to focus on a healthy diet *a lot*. But still it feels like an uphill battle. I still often struggle with wanting to go and eat shitty food like fantasizing about a whole **bar** of Milka Chocolate... Even though I know they are terribly bad for me, I sometimes want to eat them in bulk. Even just writing this made my mouth water and for a second some part of my brain thought about a way to get some of that delicious [Milka with Toffee Hazel Nut](#TODO). Why?

And whenever I read news, I can not help but feel anxious, to feel threated by the world around, how broken it is, how large the big problems loom and also about how stupid "the others" are. It feels like everything is a black and white picture, those are the good guys, those are the bad guys, and they are only 100% good or 100% bad. There is no nuance to  news anymore and whenever I read either of the sides, I feel enraged at how the other side can think *that*?! 

Why?

What a diverse set of things huh? Anxiety, polarization, obesity, shrinking attention spans, addictions...

As we will see though, all of these problems and the fact that all of them are on the rise, big time, have a common factor, a common origin and it's what I call: The Problem at the Heart of Capitalism. 

Before we get to that let me paint a picture of my own struggles with those trends:

## My own struggle

To me the two I am most affected is addiction. I feel like I suffer from addictions of various kinds very much. And I know enough of my friends who struggle in just the same way.

I am addicted to computer games, pornography and YouTube to a certain extent, which is scary if I actually stop to think about how much time I spend doing these things on a week to week basis. Sometimes I just feel like I have no choice but to do these things, despite not enjoying them all that much anymore. Sometimes I can even sit there in front of my computer, detached, and observing myself in my own mind, thinking: "Why the heck are you doing *this* right now? Didn't you want to do something much more important?"

And all too often I catch myself even coming up with excuses to answer that question, lingering in my own mind: "Nah... I am tired today, or I am not that well, my energy is low, so it's fine to watch YouTube just today."

Those are excuses to keep a destructive behavior in my life, excuses concocted by an addicted brain, where the addicted part hijacks the thinking part to come up with creative ways to explain that behavior and rationalize it so that it doesn't feel as bad (more on how that works exactly will come later). 

I literally lie to myself so that I can "enjoy" the pleasures of addiction again or for longer, suffering all the while, because it's not what *I* really want to do. Anybody who has suffered from something like this should resonate with a quote from the Bhagavad Gita:

> The self is a friend for him who masters himself by the Self; but for him who is not self-mastered, the self is the cruelest foe.

My Self is a foe to me. 

That's what it means to struggle with addiction. I still consider myself lucky, because I can still think of myself as a "functional" addict. Somehow my life hasn't collapsed around the things I am addicted to yet, and I work, have healthy relationships and maintain a semblance of order. And I am aware enough of the problem, to do something about it. To fight off cravings, to reduce the amount of time lost that way, to build healthier habits and finally, eventually heal. But to get there it's a hard and arduous road and I am far from "healed". Because the anchors that trigger cravings are still there, not overgrown yet. Still there, carved into my brain.

My claim is, all of these problems, especially addiction (and their prevalence today) come from the interaction between Capitalism and our human brains. Now, ok, Capitalism itself is just an emergent phenomenon of people (brains) interacting with each other in the world, but what I mean is that Capitalism changes the ways we behave and also the underlying reasons of why we behave in any particular way at all. Because capitalism builds artifacts (products) and Capitalism is very good at finding ways to build products that exploit our brains. 

To understand what that means though, let's have a look at addiction more in depth, to learn a bit about how the human (or brains in general, it turns out the neural circuitry is quite conserved, hence rats can still become addicted to Cocaine or "porn" just as humans do) brain *actually* works. 

We want to find out and understand what addiction is on a neurological level. First of, while some people consider it a disease not everybody would agree. As we'll see, in a way, an addiction is *just* learning gone wrong and too far. What do  I mean by that? Let me explain.

## Evolutionary Rules of Thumb

In a way, humans are machines designed with a few simple "rules" in place. Rules that determine what stimuli give us pleasure. Rules that govern when we feel good or bad in response to us doing certain things. 

Those rules include feeling good when doing things like eating, tending to children, exploring new areas, having sex, spending time with friends etc. We also feel bad or in "pain" when we do certain other things - like expending energy, thinking hard about something, not getting food, etc. 

Something interesting to note is that those rules are somewhat malleable to our experience. Therefore culture can play a role in modulating and changing those rules to a certain extent, influencing how and when and why we feel happy. Education therefore plays a huge role in adding rules on top. Meta rules so to speak, like:  "Hey, money is good, because it can buy us food and gives us status", so that when we earn money we feel good.

However in the end, all of those can be broken down to some association with a type of behavior that has been evolutionarily useful. How exactly this works and how culture and experience influence the things we want and desire or fear and abhor is a much more complicated topic ( [and a topic for another post](#TODO)).

## Prediction Machines

Our brains are prediction machines, neural networks firing in response to stimuli from the world (let's call stimuli from world simply input). 

They not only respond directly and immediately but also adapt and change their structure. Brains literally rewire in response to inputs. So the same input presented to our brains twice, doesn't necessarily produce the same output, because the first time it arrived it might have changed the brain a little bit. This is the basis of all learning.

We are always trying to capture spatial and temporal patterns. Those patterns are useful, because us human reproduction machines can then exploit those patterns to find ways to sustain and reproduce ourselves. 

Patterns found we find are always evaluated by the rules of thumb mentioned above. 

Judging by these patterns, brains then try to find regularities in the world. Regularities that we can learn and that fundamentally help us to survive better. When we do find those regularities, our brains motivate us to exploit them. It's a simple pattern of "I did a) in a context of b) and then I felt *good* hence let's do more of a) the next time we are in context a". Or I felt bad, and therefore I should not do a) or even avoid context b) entirely. This is what psychologists refer to as conditioning. Put a rat in a box and teach it to associate food with the ringing of a bell followed by it pressing a lever, it will go and press the lever every time a bell rings, because it has learned that it can get food that way. Humans work in much the same way, only that our levers and bells are much more complicated, and that we are much smarter than rats (or so we think).
