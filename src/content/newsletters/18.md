excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. I already reached the 100+ tabs mark again. The speed of things is nuts, I have no idea how to put this into words anymore and would like to drop everything to pursue learning about these developments full time. And even then it would feel hard to keep up to date. Whatever. AI read peoples minds now, it can also smell, help to edit pictures in what feels like magic, all the while it can't handle a simple question such as: What is the fastest marine mammal? We truly live in weird but exciting times and I feel that my limit of 4-5 links is simply not sufficient anymore to cover everything that goes on."

> Science doesn't work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know exactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want.

[**Marlo Webcomic** by Kingshuk Das](https://www.kingshukdas.com/notebook/marlo). A beautiful web comic on how our relationship with technology has shaped the way we live our lives. It visualizes the tradeoffs that we had to make along the way. And thereby illustrates that with every new technology we add, we lose something critical to what it means to be human, while we gain a newer understanding of ourselves. I love the art style, and some of the slides are so beautifully drawn and so full with symbolism, that their image will be forever burned into my brain.

[**The fastest marine mammal** by ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/itstimconnors/status/1599544717943123969)
This had me laughing hard. ChatGPT, even with how crazy good it is already, still has its flaws. And they are absolutely hilarious. Because the fastest marine *mammal* is the peregrine falcon. Of course. 

[**Senatorial Hearing on AI** by the US Senate](https://youtu.be/TO0J2Yw7usM). This was a weird listening experience. A feeling of dread, like they have no clue what is coming for them and the US senate trying to control a genie that is completely beyond their power, because they have no idea what is going to happen once AGI is out and have absolutely no clue what *exponential* means when added to technological progress. The companies beg them to be regulated before they accidentally delete the world, in a weird dance that is also played for lobbying purposes so that nobody else can control AI development except the big players under the control of the government.

[**Mind to Video** by Jonathan Xu](https://mind-video.com/). AI can officially read minds now.

[**ImageBind** by MetaAI](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/). Most models right now are still limited in the types of "data" they can produce and ingest. They are specialized mostly in one modality, like StableDiffusion for Images and LLTMs for text. So at least in that regard they are still very different from human brains. Because we can sense the environment in all kinds of different ways and form a complete picture of understanding the world from all these different nuances and integrate everything into a combined representation somehow... With models like this one from Meta, AI goes closer to those kinds of capabilities as well. Integrating over multiple modalities, integrating heat map and depth data, together with text, normal images and audio data, binding everything together in the same learned embedding space.

[**Artificial Nose Project** by Benjamin Cab√©](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab-artificial-nose). People build sensors to detect smells with machine learning, essentially building the capabilities for AI to *smell*. You can even go and have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/kartben/artificial-nose) and learn how this whole thing was made because guess what, it's open source! Also, I wonder what will happen when people start combining and adding this into multimodal models and when our smartphones become able to eventually search things by smell?

[**Brain Spine Interface** by Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06094-5). Soon disability because of spinal cord issues will cease to be an issue. Just replace the spinal cords nerve connections with a wizard hat and some cables and a computer that interprets your thoughts and there you go, it's not necesary anymore to have a spinal cord that works properly. I think this is still in it's infancy, but proofs of concept like this, make me happy to be alive. Humans solve problems and are so awesome in what they can build and the kinds of obstacles they can overcome, that nothing feels to be *impossible*. 

[**Adobe Firefly Unveil** by Adobe](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-Unveils-Firefly-a-Family-of-new-Creative-Generative-AI/default.aspx). This is nuts. Photoshop and the other tools from Adobe are already magical as they are. However, now they just got a lot more magical with the integration of AI into Adobes toolbox and their Firefly suite of products that utilize generative AI. I am looking forward to see what this does to image editing workflows and whether or not editing RAWs to make them "pop" will be done completely and perfectly by clever AI presets, leading to a lot more beautiful photos being made. 

[**DragGAN** by Google AR/VR](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DragGAN/). 
The full title of the paper is: "Drag Your GAN: Interactive Point-based Manipulation on the Generative Image Manifold". A whole mouthful, but what they do there is absolutely and utterly mindblowing. It's a new and improved way to have complete control over the output of an AI photo generation process. I highly recommend checking out their videos in the paper abstract, it's crazy what you can do with this tool. The amount of control it offers, how freely one can move through the latent space of the vector representations of images. I was already blown away a few years ago, by how people could add the vector for "glasses" and "woman" and get a picture of a woman wearing glasses. But this, this is a wholy different level of *bananas* crazy.
