## ‚ú® Quote ‚ú®

> Look at the pattern this seashell makes. The dappled whorl, curving inward to infinity. That's the shape of the universe itself. There's a constant pressure, pushing toward pattern. A tendency in matter to evolve into ever more complex forms. It's a kind of pattern gravity, a holy greening power we call viriditas, and it is the driving force in the cosmos. Life, you see.

‚Äì Kim Stanley Robinson

[**Atoms are Local** by Century of Bio](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/atoms-are-local). Biotech is a fascinating discipline right now, and a lot of things are happening that many people are unaware of. Especially complementing biotechnology with AI in the right ways can lead to a future where "everything grows on trees". A future where anything we would like to have, can be created, and grown from organic materials, within our own homes. This piece dives into an exploration of how such a world might look like and how companies are striving towards this future *right now*. This blog, overall, is pretty awesome. 

[**Metagenomic Atlas** by Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/). Even faster methods to solve the problem of protein structures are necessary, to understand *all* the proteins there are. Knowing the structure of a protein can help identify potential uses for it; therefore, the more proteins we know the shape of, the better. This paper developed a new method that can run protein shape predictions from DNA samples an order of magnitude faster. These models can go from a DNA sequence to the protein shape in a matter of seconds which makes running them on whole databases of DNA samples possible.

[**Democratizing AI Interview, with Emad Mostaque** by Scale AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k124oUlY_6g). AI, right now, is in the hands of a handful few major companies. The amount of data and computation necessary to build, train and maintain awesome models like ChatGPT, Dall-e, AlphaZero, AlphaTensor, and such are gargantuan and only a few big players in the field, like Microsoft, Google or Meta have the resources to do so. However, that's a very bad thing, considering the potential disruptions that breakthroughs in AI might have in the not-so-soon future. That's why Emad Mostaque founded Stability AI. To have a corporation that is designed so that its research results are publicly accessible and open source. So that everybody can help build this future and ensure it goes in a way that is beneficial to all. This interview dives into Emad's thinking behind this and what they are doing at Stability AI.

[**Spinoza ‚Äì A complete guide to life** by Then & Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leoBccWOZfo). I love this channel. Deep philosophical and political topics are dissected into beautiful documentary-length videos. Well researched and looking at things from different angles. This specific piece is about Spinoza, a philosopher that argued why we should learn more about the world. And why such a state of learning is the only ethical thing we can do. And how knowledge can lead to a happier life overall. A lot of this is how I see the world too, so it resonated with me and put the works of Spinoza higher up on my reading list.
