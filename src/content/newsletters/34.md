excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time Google has announced that their AI can solve mathematical olympiad problems, Prophetic AI is trying to induce lucid dreaming states with AI, and Javier Milei's speech went wild on the internet, with an AI dubbed version being even better. As always I hope that you enjoy this edition of Live and Learn."

> I’ve tried blanketing myself in books. Eventually they saturate my mind; the soggy attention not letting in one more grain of sugar; one more grain of someone else’s thoughts. Other peoples’ thoughts are a kind of sedative—they’ve already done the hard work of thinking them.

## 🖇️ Links 🖇️

[**Alpha Geometry** by Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry). AI is getting closer and closer to reasoning with every passing week. This work by the Deepmind team uses a combination of symbolic reasoning and LLMs to create plans to analyze and solve geometrical mathematical olympiad problems. The resulting model can answer 25 out of 30 questions and is on par with human performance. This is crazy. It's an AI that can *reason* about geometry. 

[**Morpheus 1** by Prophetic AI](https://twitter.com/PropheticAI/status/1750534355242418300). Some of the craziest stuff I've seen in a while. They are trying to read brainwaves, parse them with a neural network and then emit ultrasonic waves to induce lucid dreaming states. It's quite "out there" in terms of what people do with AI and gives a glimpse into things that might eventually become normal: AI enhanced, dreamlike conscious experiences.

[**Javier Milei's AI dubbed speech**](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1747870867902926899). The beautiful side of the deepfake technologies that I covered in the last newsletter is that you can also use them to create dubs that preserve the accent of the speaker and *feel* natural. This speech given at the World Economic Forum went viral and I listened to it in Spanish with English subtitles first, but this version, generated with [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/), is *much* better. It seems surreal that you can soon watch any content in any language you want, while also preserving the voices and mannerisms of speech of the original. 

[**Solugen** by Jeff Burke](https://jeffburke.substack.com/p/solugen-the-first-carbon-negative). A wonderful article detailing how Solugen aims to create all sorts of petrochemicals at a fraction of the current costs by using advanced biochemistry. They are creating enzyme factories to quickly catalyze and drive petrochemical reactions at much lower temperatures and pressures. This reduces the amount of waste and dangerous chemicals that need to be used as well as CO2 released into the atmosphere during the process tremendously. It's essentially => plant syrup + water + energy in => plastics and solvents etc. and still safely disposable water out.

That's all for this time. I hope you found this newsletter useful, beautiful, or even both!
