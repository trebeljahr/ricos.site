I am sitting alone in my room. It is dark outside and my speakers play some soft and mellow music. FKJ, beautiful piano, some techno mixed into it. It is from one of my favorite performances - a video from Cercle where he plays in front of no audience in the middle of nowhere in Bolivia in the Salar de Uyuni - a large flooded salt flat.

The sun sets in the background while he plays, the sky mirroring itself in clear body of water that stretches beyond where the eye can see. The scene is beautiful and the music serene. One day I want to go there, but I wonder when that will happen. Currently I am sitting in my room at night, my mind wandering, reading a book, enjoying a warm cup of tea.

My mind drifts of from the book that I am reading because it is late and I can not properly concentrate myself anymore. There is a soft dullness that is overcoming my body as the time goes on, closing my eyes, following the music and trains of thought that plop up in the mind from seemingly nowhere.

It is wonderful.

Those moments where you think about things and reflect and don't want time to be continuing, where you are in your room alone at night, listening to some music that you enjoy.

## Reasons?

The usual questions pop up, what am I doing here, where do I want to go, there is just so many awesome things. Only yesterday I started building a minecraft-clone, learning another technology (threejs) to do so online. Why am I doing it? My mind searches for the monetary gain that the activity could provide me, but truth be told it is like so many things I do.

There is no monetary value in them, I do them because I enjoy them, that is the whole point. Nobody pays me to read, nobody pays me to learn, nobody pays me to maintain my body, nobody pays me to take photos. But my mind worries about that. I want to be paid, I don't want to struggle for money in the future, but I never really stop to think why that is the case...

## The Value of Money

Why do I actually want to have money? What is the value of it, when everything is going to be over in the end anyways? Won't I always have enough anyways and isn't that reason enough to not worry about it that much - only worry about it when the time is actually there and action needs to happen?

I want to create something of beauty, something that I can enjoy, that I am proud of having done. Working at Klarna at the moment is not that. It is a means to an end - I am doing it because I want to see the number in my ETF account grow so that I can retire early and do what ever the fuck I want to do with my time.

During after hours I will read, gorge my brain on things I actually enjoy only to start the next day working again at something that I fundamentally deep down don't care about an iota. Something that makes people spend their money in mindless pursuits of new fancies... Is that really what I want to do?

But I digress... The name of this article suggests I will talk about two things: The beauty of living - and the fragility of humanity. So I should probably do that.

## The Beauty of Living

Beauty is everywhere around us. When we look at the world and try to understand how it works and make some progress in doing so that is just wonderful. The exhilaration I can feel when I understand something new while reading a book or while watching a lecture. The feeling is just pure happiness. Bliss. Those moments are what make life worth living.

## Layers Of Complexity

The wonders of knowledge and how this world works and how massively complex it really is just stagger me every single time...

How I can just listen to music... Without even thinking that there was a device somewhere picking up vibrations in the air, caused by somebodies hands manipulating an instrument, stored as tiny bumps on a magnetic disk, spinning rapidly while a small arm changes the polarization to deposit little bumps onto it.

### Servers.

Then those bumps being read and transformed again later on on the computer of the artist, read into its internal workings, then sent to a server somewhere to be stored there. So that my computer now can request that data from it to play back the music. That server kicking in again looking at the data on its storage medium, processing it.

### Wifi.

Then sending it over the wires as electromagnetic pulses, as an answer that reaches the wifi router in the next room, which re-encodes the signal again, changing it into electromagnetic fields and waves to send a message across the room that then hits the little antennae to the left of me, where the signal gets decoded again.

### Computer.

And then put into the motions of electrons across wires, to currents that can be picked up and processed by my computer. Which in turn means by millions of extremely tiny transistors, small electronic switches, manipulating the behavior of yet different currents that at some point go on and drive my speakers to reproduce the specific frequencies and patterns of sounds that were recorded.

### Speakers.

Which they do by using a membrane very similar to that used for the recording but which can be moved by an electro-magnet by precise on-off switch timing, so that it can generate similar pressure differences in the air, like those that were picked up at the beginning of the chain somewhere in the Salar de Uyuni.

### Ears.

Waves that then travel through the room towards my ears where they get funneled into a narrow space, leading to a fluid with small hairs on the walls of the canal, to vibrate in a very specific manner, leading to the bending of those hairs.

### Brain.

Hairs that bend which are attached to nerve cells, which in turn produce an electric signal when the hairs bend, which is then put into the brain. Which decodes the information in those electronic potentials, again and translates them into sounds and mental representations of melodies.

### Feelings.

Melodies that can affect my mood. Music that makes me happy. Sounds that give me goosebumps, wondering about the beauty of the universe.

Isn't that magical?

Grasping what he wanted to express with his music, transcending yet another level of complexity, beyond what notes and melodies are into the realm of human feelings and emotions.

Thinking of it that way it seems like simply listening to music, a pleasure of mine is pure, utter, complete magic. And I think it is not just this that is pure magic and wonder if looked closely at, but literally EVERY damn thing in this world is similarly beautiful and complex and intermingled at a close enough level of perception.

## Beauty and complexity are everywhere.

And then there is the aspect of reflecting on these kinds of thoughts... Of sitting down and thinking deeply about them. The idea that I can actually turn around and look at all the phenomenons happening around me and have the resources and information in my hands to understand all this magic behind what is going on in this world. I think that is what I enjoy most in life, unwrapping these layers of complexity, trying to understand how things work, because somehow that just makes me incredibly happy when I do it.

So that is the beauty of being alive. That I can think and understand the world around me, with little tendrils of thought probing out into the unknown, looking at things I understand and at the same time don't understand, using the shared resources and knowledge that all the other people before me have gathered, the knowledge they built up over the centuries, to understand more about well... everything. I think that's called curiosity. And it is what makes me happy.

Listening to music like this makes me want to create. It inspires me to create something of similar beauty myself someday. Not necessarily music, but something that I can be proud of, something that is beautiful, be that something written, code projects, games, paintings, photography... whatever. It does not even matter I just know that I want to create things of beauty, because that's what all that understanding is about. To understand the elusive idea of quality that is described so beautifully by Robert Pirsig.

### The Fragility of It All

All this beauty and the quality of being alive however has a very harsh side to it, since having all this wonder also means that there is a risk of loosing it.

The wonder is perishable.

But because of the quality of conscious experience I want it to be protected. I don't want to loose my mental state, because I love it so much. I don't want to give it away.

And I think that is the main fragility of humanity. That our lives are perishable, that our mushy insides age and some day die. That the beauty we can see and manifest in this world is some day going to end and that we have to maintain it for it to persist just that little bit longer.

I think that because of the nature of the universe there can only be intermediate solutions found to this problem. But humans can find those intermediate solutions, because we can think! We can invent! Technology enables us to transmit that beauty, raw ideas, our understanding. We can take the patterns we see in the world around us as well as the ones we create ourselves and persist them to the next generation and into the future. Not indefinitely. But if we are smart about it for very long times.

## Technology - decreasing the fragility?

That's what technology is doing. It enables us to share the patterns we create for longer and longer times and make more intricate patterns. It allows us to increase the amount of beauty in the world. And it can help us to make sure that we do not perish along the way to some fluke cosmic incident.

Technology allows us to gain a deep understanding of the world. An understanding that we can use to solve the problems of fragility.

And I as an individual want to be part of that, because I don't want to perish, I don't want my life to end since it is simply too beautiful and to filled with wonder at each and every step. Understanding ourselves can maybe help with that, extending the span of lives and patterns we create beyond our wildest dreams.

But when I look at the state of the world I can not help but feel that humans are, much like me, too wrapped up in the patterns they and others have created already, to do something about the more fundamental problem.

We are to busy living our lives to realize that we lose the beauty that we are trying to protect. And we loose it both in the long and the short term. What a price to pay.

## What are we doing?

Instead of focusing more on preserving and producing more intricate patterns, we get comfortable in our lives, earning money to survive, because we care about food and our immediate rewards and life's necessities more than we care about the long term future of our patterns and ideas.

Because in the end - even though we think it is about beauty... which we only do sometimes, rarely, when alone in our room at night... a part of our brain, very strongly disagrees.

That part of the brain screams. Hey! There are more pressing problems... Like how we pay our rent at the end of the month and what our neighbors think about the old car we still have. Or what kind of suit and tie at work. And it demands that we solve these problems, before we can return to our dreams of creating patterns of intricate beauty and helping to preserve those and ourselves for eternity. Because those puny future problems can be solved at a later time. Now... Now there are important things to attend to.

Usually this part of the brain wins the argument.

And so we mostly follow in the footsteps of what most of people did for eternities. Instead of creating patterns, finding ways to escape the fragility of it all and developing our understanding of the world, we get lost in the struggle for our version of daily "survival".

Being stressed about bills we have to pay and the dentists appointments that we have missed, keeping our small jobs and small minds and never getting around to do what we are truly here for.
