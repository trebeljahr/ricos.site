excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time with articles on how AI is making programmers obsolete, how it can help in creating animated video content, and even make people fall in love with it. All the content from this week had one thing in common for me: It sent shivers down my spine, because it confronts with the amount of progress that has been made in the last 2 years. I hope you find this edition interesting. Enjoy."

[**Coding won't exist anymore in 5 years** by Somnath Singh](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/coding-wont-exist-in-5-years-this-is-why-6da748ba676c). ChatGPT + Copilot and other models like it will only get better at generating code from here on, and you can already use them to explain code you don't understand, find bugs in code you've written, add tests, document your existing code and even solve problems with algorithms or libraries that you haven't heard about. It's a crazy tool for developing applications, and a lot of code in the future will be written by AI, not by humans.

[**Love in the Time of Replica** by Patty McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/p/love-in-the-time-of-replika?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). People are already building relationships with artificial intelligences that feel "real" to them, because large language models *feel* like they can possess their own will, their own consciousness. Whether or not that is true is another debate, but the feeling of something being *there* is strong enough that people fall in love with these "beings". This is a problem, when those models get rolled back and the loved ones lose the voice that made them special. Decentralization and blockchains might be the solution.

[**Did We Just Change Animation Forever?** by Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo). The behind the scenes for [an awesome short animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVT3WUa-48Y). A small team that used AI as a video postprocessing step to do animation in a way that has never been done before. Not only is it orders of magnitudes faster than traditional methods but also doing something like this should have taken a big team months of effort. And yet here we are, where the same thing can be done in a matter of days and a modest team. To me this is mindblowing. In the future, all it needs for content creation is an original idea, a vision.

[**From Bing to Sydney** by Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/). Bing released it's version of ChatGPT to the public and people soon found a way to get the AI to display odd behavior, claiming to be a person named Sidney. The way this Sidney persona interacts with people is scary, it's doesn't act like a helpful chatbot at all anymore. But more like an actual person that makes the Replica stories from the post above more understandable. The thought that there might be a kernel of consciousness inside something that "only" predicts the next token in a sequence of words is something I can't shake anymore.  Maybe what makes us conscious is the same thing? Next sensory input prediction? How can we rule this out, with the limited understanding of consciousness that we have?

[**Heretical Thoughts on AI** by Eli Dourado](https://www.elidourado.com/p/heretical-thoughts-on-ai). Even though progress feels like it's always accelerating, there is another narrative to be found when looking at productivity statistics. Namely, even though we undergo a crazy amount of change, massive core industries and how they operate, largely remain unchanged. Even though AI and massive advances in computing are realities. How exactly all of this plays out, remains to be seen, but I found this very interesting since it shows that the story of progress is more complicated than one might believe at first glance.
