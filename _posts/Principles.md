1. Always fight the monkey brain. If you feel this little bit of pain just before doing an activity - the want to procrastinate, you are not allowed to postpone this activity ever. Feeling this pain should be the definitive trigger to do the activity. Right at that moment, you have to fight against an old part of your brain that is evolutionarily useful but leads to bad outcomes today. So go. Fight. 
2. Spend a lot of time learning new things. The world is marvelous and extremely complex. Curiosity is your compass and knowing the world is extremely exhilarating. Never forget that you know almost nothing and that there is infinity of unknown uncharted terrain left yearning you to be explored. 
3. Don't forget your friends and people close to you. Spend time with them. The ones you care for, who also care for you, might very well be the most important thing there is. 
4. Go outside. 
5. Do sports. 
6. Enjoy nature and food. 
7. Sleep plenty. 
8. Eat healthy - you know: intermittent fasting, lots of calories from protein, little high carbs stuff, decrease (eliminate?) sugar, drink green tea, don't mix fats with carbs, little processed foods, not too much nuts, care about the quality of fats. Lean, grean, marine. Enough fish, not too many eggs, some good meat, lots of veggies. 
9. Be grateful. Notice when people do something cool, awesome or whatever and tell them that they rock. 
10. Exercise skills regularly so they do not atrophy. Piano, Painting, Programming, Writing, Thinking. 
11. Recognize addictions and lost control. Determine their impacts and then stop them completely if necessary. (Usually it is necessary) 
12. The universe is a stressful place and to err, fail and aggress is sadly very human. Be aware of that. Smile, greet and appreciate.
13. If sad/bogged down, think about the crazy facts of wonderfully marvellous physical reality. the complexity that governs entities interacting with each other and the scale and utter meaninglessness AND beauty of it all. Remember the blue dot, the life calendar, the photons hitting your eyes, the blind card magician, the connectedness of mathematics and physics and the craziness of the Fermi Paradox, and that we might very well be alone in an infinite universe. 
14. Also remember the atrocities and cruelty humans and by extension theoretically you are capable of and put them into perspective to what you have to endure. 
15. Think about the fact that you have so much and appreciate that you are alive healthy, probably not starving or dying of thirst have clothes, education and technology and live a live that by comparison is A LOT better than the lives of almost any other human that has ever walked upon earth. So do not forget even if things are bad - they could be a lot worse.
16. Remember that there is boogie woogie, jazz and music in general that swinging air can change your mood and make you move your feet. 
17. See that while things are great, they can always be improved. Especially when looking at them in the long or very long term future. 
18. Ask yourself how you can make things better in the long term and then do the actions necessary to get closer towards that better future. Whatever better means in the long run. 
19. Stick with things long enough to see how far you can go and don't end up endlessly switching between the newest fads of yours. Do not lose the jungle for all the trees and get lost in choices overwhelmed and bogged down by the knowledge that by spending time you lose the opportunity to do anything else with that time. 
20. Be aware of your own biases, flaws and terrible nature. Know that you know basically nothing and that even the things you think you know are probably wrong. Remember that there is the Dunning Kruger Effect and similar biases and that all of these cloud your thinking and tend to lead to overvaluing one's own opinions. 
21. Try to move closer to truth by pulling at and updating your own beliefs continually. To do so search more facts and opinions that are conflicting with your own - try to disprove your ideas instead of proving them and then watch and see if they hold. Think of new ones. Iterate.
22. Know that other people want to be and ARE important. Not only to themselves but also to you. Without others you cannot do shit. The marvels of society work in the background not because of you but because of other people that you do not even know much less care about. 
23. Maybe even more importantly know that other people can be mightily different from you and what you know and that understanding others is a lot less common and way way harder than you would ever think. Misunderstanding is the default nature and making yourself understood properly as well as understanding others is one of the hardest things to do.
24. Remember that predicting the future from past data is often impossibly hard and eventually bound to fail in this messy chaotic world. There are black swans. So tread with the necessary caution and handle risks accordingly. 
25. And: Don't Panic.
