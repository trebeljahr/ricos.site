I am currently in Berlin, at home, working for [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com) as
a "part-time web development lead teacher". This means that I teach people how to program to earn a living.

It also means that I only work for 12 hours a week and have the rest of my time free for working on personal projects. 

When not working for Ironhack, I spend my time working on one of my [1-month projects](/1-month-projects). This month (November 2022) I am completing more book summaries for the booknotes (plan is to finish 40+) and traveling to Tenerife to escape the winter in Germany. 

I also try to read a lot and you can find what I have read, some of it with notes at the [/booknotes](/booknotes) of this site.

Besides this, I regularly have long, drawn-out discussions with friends, play a lot of beach volleyball and go to Hell Night, a parkour-focused strength/endurance training in Berlin, every week.
