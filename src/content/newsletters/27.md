excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This one is absolutely packed with crazy stuff, Adobe had it's annual Adobe Max Conference, Nvidia is succesfully training Robots within a simulation using Large Language Models, and the biggest brain cell type Atlas has been released in the last 2 weeks. As always, I hope you enjoy this edition of Live and Learn."

[**Eureka: Using GPTs to train Robots** by Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/10/20/eureka-robotics-research/). In this research Nvidia successfully manages to automatically assign and code reward policies for robots and novel tasks using GPT-4. This makes policy based reinforcement learning much easier than it has ever been before. They claim that this approach outperforms human written Reinforcement Learning Policies on 80% of tasks. Nvidia is doing some crazy stuff in AI these days and if you haven't you should also checkout and see the [actual research paper results (+ code etc.)](https://eureka-research.github.io/), and some other stuff Nvidia does: like [the Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and the [Omniverse](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse)... It is *absolutely crazy* what they are building with all of this and it will accelerate robotics and the way that we build smart machines that can interact with the real world tremendously. This truly is a "Eureka" moment.

[**Adobe Max Keynote**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=1tbrJNP5Cjk). Another KeyNote by one of the big players in the generative AI field. Adobe has been integrating generative AI capabilities already over the last months into most of their signature apps and they continue to do more of the same. Image and video editing will change a lot over the coming months and years. Just like Meta's Keynote from [Newsletter #26](/newsletter/26) I enjoyed this one a lot.

[**Largest Brain Cell Type Atlas Map Ever Made** by Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03192-2). The Human Brain is complex not only because of the millions of neurons interacting with one another, but also because there are myriads of different other cell types, supporting and helping the neurons do their job. Not everything in the brain is neurons, and not even all neurons are the same. And now we have a map of this that can help us gain a better understanding of these different cells and how they relate and support one another. The full source data can [be found over here too](https://nemoarchive.org/).

[**AGI is already here** by Noema](https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/). In this thought provoking piece the authors argue that the systems that we currently have will be categorized as early versions of Artificial General Intelligence in the future. Because the AI that we have right now is already general, excelling in many different tasks, many of them tasks that the original models weren't exactly trained for. Sure they are still weak and can be improved tremendously, but so were the earliest *general* purpose computers.

[**The Techno Optimist Manifesto** by a16z](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/). A16z is one of my favorite blogs, and this piece kicks it out of the park. It's about *why* and *how* we should be optimistic about the future and the prospects that technology offers. In a few pages it sums up how the world should be and what is good and bad in it. Growth is good, energy is good, cheap prices are good, and technology enables all of it. I enjoyed reading this *a lot* and it reminds me a lot of the work of David Deutsch.
 
[**How to Eradicate Malaria** by DeNovo](https://denovo.substack.com/p/will-no-one-rid-me-of-this-turbulent?publication_id=360716&post_id=137851347). We have the means to engineer genetically altered mosquitoes, that can end Malaria once and for all with a technology called a "gene-drive". We had those means for years, but yet Malaria still exists... This post tries to answer the question why? And then asks if we should just do it instead of hiding behind politics and regulations and hypothesises how much it would cost to *actually* execute on this idea and eradicate Malaria for good.

[**Beautiful Places AI**](https://beautifulplaces.ai/). These people build a dataset only about beautiful places. Images and Metrics, that aim to clearly define what it means for a place to be *beautiful*. This collective makes the case that we need more beautiful places in the world, *and* that AI can help with that. I find this super cool, because beautiful things are one of the main reasons why I travel. And having that beauty catalogued so that machines can learn and understand what it means for something to be beautiful sounds awesome because this way we can also teach the machines to create more of it. And maybe even find *new* beautiful styles and designs that we haven't thought of before. Sort of like move 37 but in design.

[**Using Digit Humanoid Robots** by Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-introduces-new-robotics-solutions). Apparently, not just Nvidia is doing crazy stuff with robots. In fact over 750000 of them... Amazon started deploying their own humanoid robots now too. And in typical Amazon fashion they approach everything from a practical point of view, always looking for ways to improve processes, automate work and save costs. And the humans are still there, doing jobs that previously didn't exist, amplified in their effectiveness and efficiency by the use of the robots.
