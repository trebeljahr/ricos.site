The [first post in this series](/posts/feynman-note-everything-1) was all about why it's important to not only consume content but to write Feynman notes about everything. Now this idea of "Feynman noting everything" is still quite nebulous and a big question remains - how do I go about breaking down content I consume into Feynman notes? This post is going to answer that.

## Two Types

There are two distinct types of Feynman notes. 

First you can summarize single pieces of content. Writing summaries for the main ideas in a book, or for a YouTube video, or for a podcast episode would be examples of this. These summaries have to break down the concepts so that even a child with no prior knowledge could understand them. 

Second you can synthesize across different pieces of content (even different Feynman Notes of your) and combine them together into longer form articles. This way you organize information across different sources and write something like a cross source Feynman Note. These are tied to a specific topic like, let's say, compilers or general relativity or CRISPR/CAS.

To sum this section up - there are two distinct types of Feynman Notes:
1. **Summaries** - Feynman notes tied to a specific piece of content. 
2. **Deep Dives** - Feynman notes tied to a specific topic or idea. 

Now the result we are going for are deep dives. While individual summaries are inevitable byproducts of "Feynman Noting Everything", they only act as building blocks towards creating your deep dives in the end. They are just tools to make sure that you fully engage your mind while consuming a piece of content. They are a sort of crutch designed to help you digest content better. 

The deep dives on the other hand are how the Feynman Notes are going to fit together into a tightly knit web of concepts and ideas.

Incidentally this is the way your brain works and why such an approach of organized note taking is so ridiculously effective in anchoring knowledge within your brain. By synthesizing over different sources you can get to a better understanding of well... anything. And because you put in the work of synthesizing across different sources, you will create multiple anchors within your brain, making the information stick much better.

## Guided Curiosity 

During this process, there is one thing you want to eliminate entirely: The mindless watching of informational content. 

In [Part I of this series](/posts/feynman-note-everything-1) we established that this is a waste of time, hence we want to eliminate it.

Two "rules" will help us in this process: 
**Rule 1:** Informational content can only be consumed, if needed for a Feynman Deep Dive. Without having the Deep Dive in place as an anchor, you are not allowed to consume the content - period.
**Rule 2:** Informational content when consumed, has to be accompanied by writing a summary. Otherwise you are not allowed to consume it. 

Let's call the application of those rules, *guided curiosity*. 

## The Process
Everything starts with picking something you are curious about and want to spend some time learning more about. Going in depth with it. These things should be picked carefully because to  understand something and write a proper deep dive on it is going to take a lot of time. But in the end not more time than what you would have wasted otherwise on watching videos without remembering anything. 

Once you have found something you are curious about and want to learn more about you start exploring different sources and angles of that topic. On your way to that long form article you build multiple smaller summaries of the content consumed, to engage your mind, while doing so.

While writing the summaries, you build a papertrail, that slowly circles in on the main ideas. Your understanding of the topic grows, with each summary written. You can even publish and link between different parts of that papertrail to later show where the understanding of the deep dive  comes from.

When you have written enough summaries, you want to drill down into the specifics of how the thing you are studying works, and then unpack the most important details about it and write them down in your terms *from memory* into a first initial draft of your Feynman Deep Dive. 

Then refine that initial draft, by looking at your original Feynman summaries until you have a finished deep dive. 

Which you can then publish as a piece of synthesis - your long form article take on a topic. This last part is important because putting your deep dives out into the open will do a couple of things - first they act as proof that you understand something and second they will act as a motivation to keep learning more. They will push you to refine the deep dives and eliminate errors in understanding.

So... Instead of mindlessly watching content, and being guided by the Youtube algorithm, you start with the topic you want to learn more about. From there you work your way down towards single pieces of content. Then work through those pieces, creating useful summaries along the way and uncovering more content until a cleaner and clearer picture of the thing you are trying to learn emerges. Finally you combine the breadcrumbs from the content summaries into a longer form article and publish it to show what you have learned.
