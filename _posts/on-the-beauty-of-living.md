I am sitting alone in my room. It is dark outside and my speakers play some soft and mellow music. FKJ, beautiful piano, with some techno mixed into it. The video is from one of my favorite performances, where FKJ plays in front of no audience, in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere in this case is the Salar de Uyuni - a large flooded salt flat in Bolivia.

The sun sets in the background while he is playing. And a clear body of water stretches beyond the horizon and mirrors the sky. Music and scene are wonderful. They match each and complement each other. 

One day I want to go to that salt flat, but I wonder when that will happen. Because currently I am sitting in my room, my mind wandering, enjoying a warm cup of tea. It is late at night.

My mind drifts away from the book I was reading just moments ago because it is late and I can not properly concentrate anymore. There is a soft dullness in my mind. A dullness overcoming my body as the time passes. I am closing my eyes, following the music and trains of thought pop up in the mind.

It is wonderful.

Those moments, where you think about your life and reflect inwards. Where you don't want time to continue. The moments where you are in your room alone at night, listening to some music that you enjoy. The moments where you simply stay in them. Relaxed and calm. 
Lost in a beautiful state of consciousness.  Those are the moments I live for. 

## Disturbances. 

Those states of mind are disturbed, when the usual questions pop up: What am I doing here? Where do I want to go? Why are there so many awesome things? How can I not want to try them all? 

Only yesterday I started building a minecraft-clone, learning another technology (three.js) to do so. Why am I doing it? My mind searches for the monetary gain that the activity could produce, but the truth is, there is none.

Many of the things I do have no monetary value attached to them. Yet they are more valuable than money could ever be. I do them because I enjoy the activity itself. For it's quality of experience, of consciousness, that is the whole point. 

Nobody pays me to read, nobody pays me to learn, nobody pays me to maintain my body, nobody pays me to take photos. But my mind still worries about that. I want to be paid, I don't want to struggle for money in the future, but I never really stop to think why that is the case...

## The Value of Money.

Why do I actually want to have money? What is the value of it, when everything is going to be over in the end anyways? Won't I always have enough to live? And isn't that reason enough to not worry about it too much? 

I want to create something of beauty, something that I can enjoy, something that I am proud of having done. 

Working at Klarna is not that. It is a means to an end - I am doing it because I want to see the number in my ETF account grow so that I can retire early and do what ever I want to do with my time.

During after hours I will read, gorge my brain on things I actually enjoy. Only to start the next day again, working my life away at something that I deep down don't care about at all. I work on something that makes people spend their money in mindless shopping... 

Is that really what I want to? The answer is no.

But I digress... The name of this article suggests I will talk about two things: The beauty of living - and the fragility of humanity. So.

## The Beauty of Living

Beauty is everywhere around us. When we look at the world and try to understand how it works and make some progress in doing so that is just wonderful. 

The exhilaration I can feel when I understand something new, while reading a book or watching a lecture. That feeling, that moment... is just pure happiness. Bliss. Those are what make life worth living.

## Layers Of Complexity

The wonders of knowledge and how this world works and how massively complex it really is just excite me every single time I stop to notice and think about them. 

Simple facts become almost magical mysteries. 

The fact of how I can just listen to music... 

Without even thinking about the fact that there was a microphone involved somewhere along the way. A device picking up vibrations from the air, which somebody playing an instrument caused. And then turning them into patterns of electric currents, which can then be stored as tiny bumps on a magnetic metal disk. 

A disk that is spinning around rapidly while a small arm darts back and forth across the metallic surface, changing it's polarization corresponding to the currents picked up by the microphone... Forming little bumps in the metal, which encode the information that underlie the patterns of the vibrations picked up earlier. 

### Servers.

Then those bumps can be read and transformed again later. On the computer of the artist, where they are read into its internal memory, processed, and eventually sent to a server somewhere to be stored there. 

Stored, so that my computer can request the data from that server to play back the music. How my computer can even know that there is this piece of music, how there is a physical connection, a wire connecting the two machines. 

### Networks.

Photons that dart through the glass fibre cables, communicating my intention to listen to the music. The server knowing how to answer that intention by looking at the bumps on the magnetic disc. And sending the information encoded within them back across the wire, as patterns of photons. 

As an answer that eventually reaches the wifi router in the next room, which re-encodes the signal again, changing it into electromagnetic fields and waves to send a message across the room. 

A message that then hits the little antennae on my computer, where the signal gets decoded again into the format specified by USB 3.0. 

### Computers.

And then put into the motions of electrons across wires, to currents that can be picked up and processed by my computer. Which in turn means by millions of extremely tiny transistors, small electronic switches, manipulating the behavior of yet different currents that at some point go on and drive my speakers to reproduce the specific frequencies and patterns of sounds that were recorded.

### Speakers.

Which they do by using a membrane very similar to that used for the recording but which can be moved by an electro-magnet by precise on-off switch timing, so that it can generate similar pressure differences in the air, like those that were picked up at the beginning of the chain somewhere in the Salar de Uyuni.

### Ears.

Waves that then travel through the room towards my ears where they get funneled into a narrow space, leading to a fluid with small hairs on the walls of the canal, to vibrate in a very specific manner, leading to the bending of those hairs.

### Brains.

Hairs that bend which are attached to nerve cells, which in turn produce an electric signal when the hairs bend, which is then put into the brain. Which decodes the information in those electronic potentials and translates them into sounds and mental representations of melodies.

### Feelings.

Melodies that can affect my mood. Melodies and music that can make me happy. The magic of sounds that gives me goosebumps and lead to me wondering about the beauty of the universe.

Grasping what FKJ wanted to express with his music... and in doing so transcending yet another level of complexity, beyond what notes and melodies really are, vibrations in the air, into what they represent for us humans. 

Translating everything back into the realm of human feelings and emotions, where they came from.

Isn't that magical?

Thinking of it that way it seems like simply listening to music, a pleasure of mine is pure, utter, complete magic. 

And I think it is not just this that is pure magic and wonder if looked at closely with a lot of attention to the details going on. 

But literally **everything** in this world is like this. Similarly beautiful and complex. Similarly magical. 

## Beauty and complexity are everywhere.

And then there is the aspect of reflecting on these kinds of thoughts... Of sitting down and thinking deeply about them. 

What does that even mean? 

The idea that I can actually turn around and look at all the phenomenons happening around me... That I have the resources and information in my hands to understand all this magic behind what is going on in this world. 

I think that is what I enjoy most, unwrapping these layers of complexity, trying to understand how this mysterious world work. Somehow that just makes me incredibly happy. 

There is a sense of childlike wonder, when I approach the world like this. And it makes me smile every single time.

So that, to me, is the beauty of being alive. That I can think and understand the world around me. 

Extending little tendrils of thought into the world. Tendrils probing out into the unknown, looking at things I know and at the same time don't understand. 

Using the shared resources and knowledge that all the other people before me have gathered, the knowledge they built up over the centuries, to understand more about reality.

I think that's called curiosity. And it is what makes me happy.

Listening to music like this makes me want to create. It inspires me to create something of similar beauty myself someday. 

Not necessarily music, but something that I can be proud of, something that is beautiful, be that something written, code projects, games, paintings, photography... whatever. It does not even matter. 

I just know that I want to create things of beauty, because that's what all that understanding is about in the end. To understand, is to be able to create. To understand is to know the elusive idea of quality that is described so beautifully by Robert Pirsig.

### The Fragility of It All

All this beauty and the quality of being alive however have a very dark cousin. Since having all this wonder means that there is a risk of loosing it.

Wonder is perishable.

But because the quality of experience is so miraculous, I want it to be protected. I don't want to loose my mental state, because I love it so much. I don't want to give it away. I don't want to die. 

And I think that is the main fragility of humanity. That our lives are perishable, that our mushy insides age and some day, eventually, die. 

That the beauty we can see and manifest in this world is some day going to end and that we can only hope to maintain it just that little bit longer.

I think that the nature of the universe seems to only allow intermediate solutions to this problem. 

But at least humans can find those intermediate solutions, because we can think! We can invent! 

Technology enables us to protect that beauty. Our raw ideas, our understanding of the world. We can take the patterns we see in the world around us as well as the ones we create ourselves and persist them to the next generation and into the future. Not indefinitely... But if we are smart about it for a very long time. 

## Technology - decreasing the fragility?

That's what technology can do for us. It can enable us to share the patterns we create for longer and longer times. Furthermore it allows us to make more intricate patterns. It allows us to increase the amount of beauty in the world by both creating new kinds of it and preserving the beauty already created. 

And it can help us to not perish forever because of some fluke cosmic incident. Like an asteroid impact or a gamma ray burst.

Technology allows us to gain a deep understanding of the world. An understanding that we can use to solve the fundamental problem of our own fragility. But it can also enhance that problem gravely.

When I look at the state of the world I can not help but feel that humans are, much like me, too wrapped up in the patterns they and others have created already, to do something about the more fundamental problem.

We are to busy living our lives to realize that we are losing the very beauty we are trying to protect. And we loose it both in the long and short term. Why? 

## What are we doing?

Instead of focusing more on preserving and producing more intricate patterns, we get comfortable in our lives, earning money to survive, because we care about food and our immediate rewards and life's necessities more than we care about the long term future of our patterns and ideas.

Because in the end - even though we think it is about beauty... which we only do sometimes, rarely, when alone in our room at night... a part of our brain, very strongly disagrees.

That part of the brain screams. Hey! There are more pressing problems... Like how we pay our rent at the end of the month and what our neighbors think about the old car we still have. Or what kind of suit and tie at work. And it demands that we solve these problems, before we can return to our dreams of creating patterns of intricate beauty and helping to preserve those and ourselves for eternity. Because those puny future problems can be solved at a later time. Now... Now there are important things to attend to.

Usually this part of the brain wins the argument.

And so we mostly follow in the footsteps of what most of people did for eternities. Instead of creating patterns, finding ways to escape the fragility of it all and developing our understanding of the world, we get lost in the struggle for our version of daily "survival".

Being stressed about bills we have to pay and the dentists appointments that we have missed, keeping our small jobs and small minds and never getting around to do what we are truly here for.
