## Summary

<p>{excerpt}</p>

This sci-fi book tickled my brain. There are so many beautiful things in it and the ideas and creativity in it are simply extraordinary. Robert L. Forward has a knack of writing highly interesting science fiction novels, and this is one of them. It is part I out of II. The second novel [Starquake](/booknotes/starquake) is also highly recommended and worth reading, however I think the first one is slightly better overall.
