A question I often ask myself is this: Why do I value computer games, where I can progress a lot in a short amount of time, less, than I value real-life things, where it takes a lot more work and effort to progress and feel this sense of progression?

Why do I get a bad feeling when playing games? Why don't I get such feelings when doing parkour or painting? Even though both are in the grand scheme of things equally senseless and their only value to me is that they make me happy by providing me with a forward arrow of progress? Shouldn't I be more content with the progress I get from games, because I am progressing a lot more in a shorter time?

I think this boils down to two things: the nature of challenge and the cultural in-acceptance attached to computer games. I think both are connected so let's explore those two concepts in depth:

### Challenges? 

Computer games are artificially created things, that provide just the right amount of challenge. But the challenges are unlike so many others inherently worthless. But the hardness of the challenge and the way it is rewarded are different from other real skills and even more importantly.


### Social Acceptance 
Society does not accept it and there is a small part in almost every human that needs to be accepted by others. Which is why playing computer games is bad. This voice that says, nah... nobody values what you have done there, therefore it is worthless. In a way this voice sucks but since it is there, at least within my brain, I care about what other people think and this shapes my actions. 

If I want it to be true or not. Therefore, when playing computer games I am not gaining the admiration of other people and therefore the time put into them feels worth less. And that sucks. Because computer games are fun and without the guilt and shame connected to them they would be all the better. But wait... Would they be?

### Other considerations?

Or can we establish a point, that makes computer games  less worthwhile than other things humans have done. In my mind yes. There are certain things that make computer games worse than other games and other things that I would like to pursue more. For one thing playing computer games for long times every day constitutes a considerable damage to health. Sitting for to long with  bad posture eating less healthily and less heartily, doing less with friends, having less social interactions with other people and a high exposure to blue light and therefore erratic sleep rhythms are all concerns that make me think that computer games can severely harm the health of the average gamer.

The other and even graver problem is that computer games are built to be addictive. They are built so that players can lose themselves in arbitrarily set challenges and game for hours and hours and hours and eventually get addicted in a way. Because that's what a good game should do, it should get you into a flow state easily and for extended periods of time they are dangerous. Because of control. Losing control over the hours spent playing computer games is a lot easier than losing control over the hours spent writing or the hours spent climbing or doing parkour or learning a new language or coding. And that makes games and computer games in general  dangerous to the idea of how I would like to live my life. There are all these beautiful things, that I want to try, way to many to  do all of them and the depth of all of these adventures to go on is incredible.

And I do not want to spend my time only ever doing one of them, I want to experience a little bit of most and stretch myself in more than one domain and progress towards something in more than one domain. And computer games harm me in this approach, because here I am developing a singular skill, getting caught in a custom designed flow trap which at some points does not loosen its grip even against my will. And that is something I can not stand. Because it is dangering the way I would like to live my live and therefore makes me ashamed of myself. It keeps me from going where I want to and therefore I consider it dangerous. At least to myself.

Knowing that I am the kind of person who can get lost easily in playing a lot and responding very strongly to new stimuli, to new adventures, to new skills to learn, I know that I am at risk of losing myself in these kinds of environments and also knowing that the real world offers overall more valuable experiences for the reasons mentioned above - social approval and actual difficulty and value within the real world - which in the best case would mean money and less worry about losing the freedom to do whatever I want - I try to keep away from games as much as possible, because they can take away my freedom and unless you have the basic habits nailed down that prevent you from harming yourself by doing something to excessively you should avoid that thing to. At all costs, because it can in the end destroy your life and take all your dreams and aspirations down with you.
