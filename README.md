# trebeljahr - a blog of a curious person

This is the repository from which the blog at [trebeljahr.com](trebeljahr.com) is being built. The blog is built on Next.js, which generates static webpages from Markdonw, which are then served via Vercel. This allows a blazing fast website hosted for free. 

Topics of the blog include things like personal improvement, nutrition, how the brain works, how computers work, how cells work, programming related advice and more. I am planning on building tags into it and a read more section as well, but the main purpose is to get myself to publish something online. To commit to it and write, every day of the week, publishing something whenever I feel it is ready is the goal of the whole exercise. 

It should also serve as a website that is the basis for showing who I am and what I am thinking and reading about at the moment.
