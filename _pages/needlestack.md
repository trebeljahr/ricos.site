# Needlestack

This is my needlestack. But hang on, what is a needlestack you might ask?
In essence, the internet is a giant haystack of data, content, information, but a haystack that also contains some needles in between, small nuggets of gold to be found and cherished. And I collected them in the form of bookmarks, notes and more for some time now, and this collection has a name - it's my needlestack. 

So - my needlestack is my personal collection of treasures found on the internet. Things that I am glad to have found.  

Full Disclaimer: The idea of the name for it is not mine. I found it on the blog of Ethan Maurice and loved it soo much that I had to make my own list of awesome "needles". [Here's his](https://ethanmaurice.com/needlestack) in case you're curious.

## Overview:
This needlestack will be organized into different sections. You can jump from section to section from this overview and go back up to the overview at any time. Don't be afraid if things might look like a bit much, I have been using the internet for some time now and therefore have gathered quite a few resources, that I consider to be amazing. The flood of content is dense, even if restricted to only what I likeespecially much.

## Stuff on Github

Let's get even more meta. Github is a platform that people use to host code and other things, enabling the version control of Git that allows them to work together in big teams efficiently and save the history of their creations. Mostly, but not exclusively used for code, it's a huge open repository of knowledge and code. Some of the best stuff on the internet lives in spaces within githubs, called repos. 

There are even some that are so awesome, that people started building repos, that do nothing but give a listing of links to other places on Github and elsewhere on the internet - sounds familiar? It's basically the same idea as what you are reading now, but on a different platform - namely Github. 

So here is the root of that awesome (pun very much intended) project: 
[Awesome Github - A list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

You should also check out the persona maintaining that repository, [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus). He is one of the most active open source maintainers **ever** and has some crazy cool projects in his "portfolio", that you might have even used already if you are a developer yourself. 

When you browse the meta list of awesome things you will come across some cool stuff - like a list of **[awesome mind-expanding books](https://github.com/hackerkid/Mind-Expanding-Books#readme) or a

This should keep you busy for the rest of ... your lives?  ​ I have not nearly done everything on this list, I keep working step by step on the programming achievements part because I think that's a fun way to spend my time  ​

ABC - 
Programming Achievements - https://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/
they are also available as a Gist to fork: https://gist.github.com/jasonrudolph/1133830#file_programming_achievements.md

books:
Cracking the Coding Interview PDF: https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf
A crazy book on LISP - it's quite famous and has it's own acronym -> SICP: https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf
There is also a lecture series on it which is old but AWESOME: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FE88AA54363BC46 - it's one of the few that I have watched in it's entirety.
just checkout the list of free programming books: https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books

curriculums and roadmaps:
The free Coding Interview University: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#computer-science-courses
Another university curriculum: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science
Preparation for System Design Interviews (had one of these at Klarna, probably as a Junior nobody will ever ask you): https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview
    also used this for preparation: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
    and this: https://github.com/shashank88/system_design
more about algorithms and practice: https://github.com/gaerae/awesome-algorithms-education
developer roadmap for different kinds of devs: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
computer science curriculum for 5 months: https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Computer_Science_in_5_Months

there is also loads of free stuff from Google:

the rabbit hole a lot of this is linked to:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
think of it as the "meta" list - a list about awesome lists linking to the cool stuff of the internet. if you want to learn something/practice something, whatever. Just search on it there I guess and have enough content of high quality for the next few months to chew through
