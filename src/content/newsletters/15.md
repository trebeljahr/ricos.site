[**Segment Anything** by Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/segment-anything-foundation-model-image-segmentation/). Segmentation is the task of finding out the main components or objects of an image (say all trees, all cars, all dogs, and so on) and then making this identification accessible. Which part of the image shows what, where are the edges of things, etc? This crazy model released by Meta is very very good at this task. Like the title of the paper suggests it can segment *anything*. This is huge, especially for augmented reality purposes which is why Meta puts a lot of effort into researching these things. Imagine how much easier a model like this makes designing AR overlays... want to see how you would look in a new dress? Segment anything could be used to detect your body shape and overlay the design of the dress => Digital dressing rooms can become a reality. Want to know what your room would look like with different furniture, Segment Out the Old furniture, and fill it in with the new one, digitally. 

[**Wolverine** by BioBootLoader](https://github.com/biobootloader/wolverine). A GitHub repo for a Python interpreter, where the code fixes its own bugs while running. WTF. You write code, with bugs, and run it. All the error messages get routed into GPT-4 together with the code, GPT-4 adjusts the code to fix the errors and re-runs it again, and again until there are no errors left. This basically automates away debugging. Hooking this up to a test suite would be even more interesting, basically an extreme version of TDD (test-driven development) could become the norm. Define what you want, and let GPT-4 figure out the rest, recursively, until the program passes all your test cases. Soon things like this will be indistinguishable from magic.

[**Software 3.0** by Divyansh Garg](https://divgarg.substack.com/p/software-3). This is the logical next step after [Software 2.0, a famous idea piece by Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35), where he argues that building AI models to solve tasks, will replace traditional software engineering. Software 3.0 is the next step. Instead of building your own, you use *already existing* models to build Software Systems in plain English. Put in the requirements, and get out the finished software system. And with tools like the above and even more advanced things being built right now, this vision of Software 3.0 will soon become a reality. Where literally everybody can build arbitrarily complex software, without knowing about all the lower-level details. Just as people who don't know how Assembly works today, can still write complex software projects in higher-level languages like JavaScript or Python, people in the future can write programs without knowing the syntax of programming languages anymore.

[**Planning for AGI and Beyond** by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond). I missed this one when it came out, but it's really interesting to see that OpenAI puts a lot of thought into what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they think the world is going to change, because of their actions. The tagline of OpenAI is wonderful: "Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity." This post dives into what that means. On the same topic, there is a [way longer Lex Fridman interview with Sam Altman](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rAOusZcsuNtCv8mefmwND)(one of the co-founders of OpenAI). It is an interesting back-and-forth, teasing out the philosophy of the creators behind GPT-4 and ChatGPT. These people are building a crazy high-tech future and might succeed sooner than anticipated.
