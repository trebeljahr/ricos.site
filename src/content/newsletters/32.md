excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time with a paper on FunSearch, a new approach to mathematical reasoning with LLMs, people reading brain speech activity from an EEG only, and announcements of multiple new models to generate audio and 3D content. As always I hope you enjoy."

## ‚ú® Quote ‚ú®

> A poet once said, ‚ÄúThe whole universe is in a glass of wine.‚Äù We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe.

‚Äì Richard Feynman - [(source)](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_03.html)

The Feynman lectures are a wonderful series of books, completely available online for free. I highly recommend reading them, even if you are not that interested in physics. Feynman has a way of explaining the world that is just enjoyable. To get an introduction you can watch his [Fun to Imagine documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA) on YouTube. There is a wonder in the way that he looks at even the simplest things that is infectious.

[**FunSearch** by Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/). Google's Deepmind has created an approach with LLMs that let's them reason about mathematics from first principles. The LLMs discover code snippets that solve mathematical problems and improve their own solutions in a self-learning/self-play manner. Even though the results don't look "too impressive" at first glance, this is a huge step forward towards AGI. Basically Google found a way to give LLMs reasoning capabilities, in other words the ability for an algorithm to use language to "think" through a problem.

[**General World Models** by Runway](https://research.runwayml.com/introducing-general-world-models). Runway thinks that when they focus on training video generation models, they can get way better results if the model has an underlying understanding of the world it is trying to generate videos of. That's why they started a new research team focused on building models that understand the world much more like we do. The video in their announcement blog post is delightful to watch. 

[**AudioBox** by Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiobox-generating-audio-voice-natural-language-prompts/). AudioBox is a tool developed by Meta AI that can generate sound environments for all kinds of things. Describe what kinds of soundscape you want to produce, and then stitch it together in the editor, with voices, sound effects, altering the sound to fit a certain "ambience" and more. You can play around with it for free and while it still has a "toy" feeling to it now, I think that will go away in the next iteration of this, which will eventually become a very powerful tool for game developers or video editors that need soundscapes for a specific environment. 

[**Music FX** by Google](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/music-fx). Music FX is a tool developed by Google that can generate music based on text input. You can choose the genre, the mood, the instruments via prompt and it generates short musical clips for you. It's not perfect yet but it's a very cool tool to play around with and I think it's a great example of how AI can be used to aid in creation. Again, game designers and video editors can profit from this, as they can now add unique music to their projects, without having to know how to compose or the need to hire a composer.

[**3D Generation** by Stability AI](https://stability.ai/news/stable-zero123-3d-generation). The next iteration of 3D generation models by Stability AI which has much better output quality. To me it's crazy how every month there is more and more progress in the field of AI generated 3D content. And I think that by the end of 2024 we will have models that are as good at generating 3D models as Midjourney is at generating images now.

[**Optimus Update** by Tesla](https://twitter.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1734756150137225501). Tesla keeps building out the capabilities of their humanoid robot and every time they share an update it's crazy to see how fast their pace is. Now it has the ability to grasp delicate objects and hand movements that look eerily human. Still a long way to go‚Äìthe walking looks kind of weird and unstable, and really slow if compared to the running robots of Boston Dynamics but still, I can see how we move closer to a crazy sci-fi future at a crazy pace.

[**DeWave ‚Äì BrainWave Reading from EEG** by HAI Centre](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14030.pdf). There have been brain wave reading papers in the past, but most of them only used to work on FMRI data as far as I know. This one is different in that it works with only an EEG cap, a muss less involved procedure. What they have is basically a brain reading hat at this point and it will only become better from here on. Especially for people who can't speak anymore because of some health problems, this might be life-altering, especially when paired with AI voice generation primed on the voice of the person before they lost their ability to speak. They have [a Github repo here](https://github.com/duanyiqun/dewave) and a [video demo](https://youtu.be/crJst7Yfzj4) as well that is worth watching.

[**LLMs beyond Attention** by Interconnects](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/llms-beyond-attention). This post dives into a new architecture that might replace the attention based transformer that is mainly used today (GPT-4 and others are examples). It is quite technical and also quite long, but if you are interested into this sort of thing it is definitely worth the read.

I am still traveling around and thought that I'd share a few pictures of Spain and Morocco with you this time, instead of the AI generated ones from last time.
