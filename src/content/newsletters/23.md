excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. This time with a paper decoding neural stimuli into music, some resources diving into the risks that AI and other recent advances will bring to the world of biosecurity, a complete connectome of a fruit fly brain, and more. As always, I hope you enjoy this edition of Live and Learn."

[**AudioCraft** by Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiocraft-musicgen-audiogen-encodec-generative-ai-audio/). Meta open-sourced their work for generative audio synthesis. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) and the results are really good. What people are going to build based on this will be interesting because tools like this have the potential to change music production workflows forever and make creating captivating music more accessible than ever. 

[**FlyWire** by Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNcRZGC_TE). People build a complete neuron by neuron map of the brain of a fruit fly. Even the brain of a simple organism like this is incredibly complicated and has millions of neural connections, and they have now mapped all of them into a single connectome which is insane. The data is publicly available and people do all kinds of interesting things with it. There is this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sdorkenw/status/1674859033076072448) keeping track of the stuff that has been going on. 

[**Brain2Music** by Google Research](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/brain2music/). Machine Learning Algorithms become better and better at decoding neural patterns into the stimuli that have originally caused them. Previously this was mostly image reconstruction from FMRI data, but this paper shows that the same techniques can be applied to decoding musical stimuli just as well. The accuracy of the decoded patterns is still somewhat low, but that the models can even somewhat capture anything at all would have been indistinguishable from magic not too long ago. 

[**Decoding Biosecurity Defense** by Decoding Bio](https://hummingbirdventures.notion.site/hummingbirdventures/Decoding-Biosecurity-Biodefense-33c0a42d440345b9be9eda18c3814060). With the rise of AI we get better tools and methods for generating and manipulating DNA. This is wonderful but at the same time poses serious risks, because it also becomes easier to create truly terrifying bioweapons. Think Covid but more virulent and violent, killing many many more people. New AI powered tools make creating such weapons easier than ever before, and with companies offering to synthesize DNA for you, it is also easier than ever to get your hands on the necessary materials. This Notion document details the risks involved and how we could defend against bad actors before something really bad happens. There is also a [presentation on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5Xv-rmmsmY) and this [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1joiUQepouUFpIJtvaJ-yUr_oadJr0FuRrX9apvWLOLw/edit) worth checking out on the whole topic. 

[**RT-2** by DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action). Google's robotic division is moving closer and closer to making true general purpose robots a reality. This paper builds on their previous work with SayCan (based on the RT-1 architecture) and improves upon it even more by including web scale language data understanding. This leads to robots that can learn novel tasks on their own, without being explicitly shown, that also have basic reasoning capabilities just like ChatGPT does, but which they can employ in solving their tasks in new ways. And they can be instructed in plain English. All of this is pretty rad and I wonder when robots like these will become reliable enough to be commercially viable.
