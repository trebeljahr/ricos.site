When I think about life there are many problems I have, problems that I need to solve, if I want to live a fulfilled and good life. And I think that many people share these problems because they are fundamental problems. Problems with the foundation - the "fundaments" of our lives.

- Not perfect Health
- Financial Shackles
- Sloth and Procrastination
- Addictions
- Pride
  - Fear of failure
  - Comparison to others

These to me are the worst "enemies" that I will encounter in my life. Which says a lot about the state of my life, because food, water and shelter are not on this list. Which is something to be grateful about.

However, what do I mean by these problems and how do they block the path to a fulfilling life? I think all these problems have one thing in common. They prevent us [from improving our lives further](/posts/improvement). They are hindrances in the way of striving. And it is that striving, that sense of progress that is all-important in life.

Let's start with health as it is the foundation of everything else.

### Problem #1: Not perfect Health.

This one is obvious. Having a body that can support you in your endeavours of doing things you enjoy, is of utmost importance. To have a body that enables progress, you need to be healthy. 

And health is a spectrum. There are so many optimizations you can do to have a better health. Nutrition, exercise, sleep, social connections, time spent outside and stress levels are the things that come to mind. Trying to make them as perfect as possible is of utmost importance, because from this basis flows everything else. If your physical health is deteriorating it is very hard to live a fulfilled life. It is very hard to progress.

Health is not just about our bodies though, it is about mental health as well because there are many things that can destroy your psyche and your life, even though you have a healthy body. Ingredients for a healthy mind include such things as good social connections (family, friends and colleagues), an underlying purpose or goal (meaning), as well as enough rest, and perceived agency about our actions. Without those, mental health will quickly deteriorate.

A sharp, working brain, housed in a cared for body, embedded in a solid network of social contacts, striving towards a goal at peak capacity - that is what perfect health is all about. And achieving "only" that is a tough challenge already. Life is trying to get in the way, things deteriorate on their own and we need to put in work to maintain, and even more work to improve our constitution.

But it is the foundation from which everything else flows and so we should start with building that. A perfectly healthy mind and body. 

### Problem #2: Financial Shackles.

This one might be the most subtle and creeping of all of the problems that are out there, yet I feel that it is so common, that I am tremendously scared of it.

In our society we need money for everything we do. If you want to survive you will have to have a way of paying for yourself and the more time you want to spend doing stuff you love, the more you will have to worry about finding a way that can pay for all the things you need.

Being able to pursue something you love is only possible, if you have enough time to do so and the more time you have to spend on getting around to survive the daily life, the less time there will be to  do all of the stuff you want to do.

And that to me seems bad. Obviously the ideal would be to get paid for the stuff you like to do, but even that is dangerous, because when your interests change you have to find a way to get paid for your new interests and this might be hard or impossible. Leading to financial serfdom again.

Or you will have to keep doing things you don't like anymore, now only as a means to support yourself.

And the worst of it all. Circumstances can change, there can be hardships in your life or things you have to take care of that will tie you down.

To be able to do that will have such a high priority in life that it might end up being the only thing one does. Working in a shitty job, that is draining you of all your energy, just so you can provide for your family or yourself, with enough food and a warm place to sleep at night. 
And I feel this is the most cruel thing. If people are prevented from striving for a better future, because the amount of energy they need to put in just to maintain enough income to simply live is all they have. People that run as fast as they can, neglecting their health, their dreams, their purpose in life, because they have to, because of money.  

When in such situations, something goes bad it leads to even more severe and even more pressing problems. Maybe even of actual life and death. Problems of hunger and pain and thirst and cold and all the hardships that we often can not even imagine anymore, but which are still a stark reality for so so many people out there.

Getting rid of financial shackles as early as possible and in as robust a manner as possible is important. Being wealthy is a condition, not for the sake of itself, but because money buys the freedom to do what you want.

And being able to do what you want implies that you can work on making the lives of other people better. Because that, in the end, is more important than money. 

At the moment I am trying to figure out my own way of providing for myself and learning the skills and doing the work necessary, so that in the future I can provide for myself with ease and take all the time I have, to do only the things that I care for and want to do. I am acquiring my freedom and try to break free of the financial shackles the world put me in.

Freedom is having enough to sustain yourself, and no more. There is a trap at the opposite end of the spectrum, where you only think that you don't have enough and keep working on things you don't value, except for the money. This is just as bad as the forced necessity of work and has to be avoided as well. In a way this is a form of greed. The ideal is to have enough money to live comfortably, without need of work, but no more. 

### Problem #3: Sloth and Procrastination.

Both Sloth and Procrastination go hand in hand and are a fundamental problem to everything else in life. 

Humans tend to be very lazy beings. From an evolutionary standpoint this makes a lot of sense, because when being lazy we can conserve energy and the laziest humans that did not die because of too much laziness flourished in the past. They passed on more of their genes and out competed the other gene variants. Hence laziness is something that almost all of us share to a certain extent. I mean  there are genetic differences and some people are less lazy then others, because of those differences and the culture/education they grew up with. 

It turns out though, that I am not one of them. Which is a problem and something that I want to change. The nice thing about sloth is that when coupled to habits and habitification we can get around it. Habits and character can be stronger than sloth. 

We can get around the problem of being lazy and do the hard work necessary to develop skills that can propel us into zones of flow and productivity. 

Healthy habits are the solution to having the problem of sloth and something that everybody should try to get integrated into their life. 

If certain things are habitualized and triggered automatically, the time spent progressing on stuff and the time spent in states of flow skyrockets. 

And that is important, because that is what I want. I know I can be happy when I am doing stuff that I love and get lost in a state of flow. I know I am happy when I am progressing and developing my skills and even more so if I gain something that can show for that.

Habits are the key way to get there. Writing and exercising daily, painting every week, coding every day and learning languages every day as well. Practicing piano, going for walks, eating healthily, reading in the evenings, and sleeping enough... All of these are necessary things and habitification helps to do them regularly.


### Problem #4: Addictions 

To me addictions are something I struggle with very much. It's mostly computer games, but also porn, youtube, unhealthy food and smartphones. Luckily no chemical addictions, like alcohol, heroin or things like that (yet). Addictions take away our "freedom" of choice. They [bias neural networks, that fire in your brain, when you decide something](/posts/decisions). And they push those decisions away from the optimum decisions you want to make, when trying to live a fulfilled life. Therefore addictions quite successfully prevent you from living a fulfilled life. In a way, one could argue that an addicted brain is not one that is healthy, so the problems of addiction can be grouped under the problem of un-perfect health.

I can remember the times where I would sit down and play computer games for hours and hours on end, because I was addicted to them. Every so often I still fall into these patterns. In a way an addicts brain is changed forever. 

After school, I would get home, turn on the PC, watch some YouTube, while munching shitty food. Then turn to my happy little game world for hours. And that made me happy in the short term. Happy, until the point where I would eventually shut down the PC, and snap out of the immersion. Then I would start to ask myself how it happened again that I just spent countless hours without having anything to show for it...

But I was unhappy. There was so much amazing stuff out there, in the real world that I simply could not justify playing games. But I was addicted, so I kept playing. Now I am trying to reduce the time lost that way.

FOMO and the fear of death are a great motivator and companion here. Life is short and I do not want to spend it with something that I can not hundred percent justify for myself. Especially if that thing is motivated by an addiction. Computer games are this sort of thing. They have a taint of being the "wrong" thing to spend my time with. 

And I think that's because they are engineered to give a quick but also quickly vanishing and misguided sense of progress. They are reward, without building lasting flow states and progress in the real world. And [progress in the real world is what is important in life](/posts/sense-of-progress).

### Problem #5: Pride

Pride is one of the most dangerous things. And something I struggle with way more than I'd like to admit. And pride can manifest in so many different ways, it's depressing. And worst of all, pride is sneaky. In thinking you have beaten pride, you are probably inviting it back. You can pride yourself on your humility. 

#### Fear of Failure

The fear of failure is the unifying theme tying most problems in my life together. 

When problems arise and we have not prepared for them properly and even though we struggle hard and long, we can not overcome the problems and fail. That's harsh. It stings. And it's the worst way a live can go. And that's why most people fear it so much, that they don't even try.

When I think of failures, I do not think of the nice - fail and then recover stories. And after which you get on with life, I am thinking more of the kind of dramatic failure that you can not recover from, the kind of failure that eats your dreams alive, because you can not recover from it.

Luckily these complete desasters are rare (or maybe they don't exist at all or are beyond our control). Failing usually means that there are ways out but we are not wise enough to figure them out. Finding them, is the problem. And the embarassment that goes along with that failure is what the fear of failure is about. 

It's about pride, about what we want to look like. Nobody likes to be seen struggling, to be seen failing. Yet, this quality, of being able to fail, repeatedly is what is most important.

Because analyzing the problems and hardships within life we survived is an important step in avoiding fatal failures like those again in the future. Life is a constant upwards tumbling. 

If not fatal, failure is good and should be embraced. When things go awry there is always something that can be learned. Unless the failure leaves you in a situation where your hands are tied and your destiny is being written without your participation...

However most failures, at least in modern society, are not like that. 

It is up to us to find ways to overcome them. But that is the actual problem I can see sneaking in here. Because it is easy to say that one is not afraid of failures but when digging deeper one will find out that this is simply not true.

We can very easily lock ourselves down in fear of failing, not do the things we would like to do. Because we don't dare to face the odds and fail. Simply because we are afraid of what might happen.

Questions to I ask myself that help:
When I fail what is the worst possible outcome? Is that acceptable? How can I develop a strategy to get back to my feet and *keep* doing the things I *love*? 
How can I keep trying, keep making, keep creating?

#### Comparison to Others.

This is a bad problem and another manifestation of pride.

When comparing yourself to others, you can always find somebody who devoted their whole life to only this one singular purpose, somebody more gifted, more obsessed with it than you. Somebody who put in all of their soul and all of their time into doing only this one thing exceptionally well. And you can not compete with people like this, without collapsing down into doing one thing only as well. 

But people like this become more than *good*, they become so exceptionally good, that they seem superhuman. They push the boundary of what is possible and get so good that you can not compete with them. I think of people such as Alex Honnold, John Florence, Jacob Collier, Magnus Carlsen, Albert Einstein and so on.

These comparisons sap away motivation. Because we usually do not want to put in *that* much time. We want to do other stuff, we like as well and not live a life single mindedly oriented towards a single purpose. Even if it would mean that within this narrow segment of skill we could become "world-class" or even "the best". I for one don't want that. And therefore I have a much lower bound on possible skill than what other people have already reached. I can not push the boundaries. Because I am set up to broad, because otherwise the FOMO is too overwhelming. And that is *ok*. 

Because I am who I am and I am decidedly different from these other people. Now this might be an excuse to not fail at the task of becoming world-class at something, but I don't think it is. 

If you still compare yourself like this, it quickly takes the fun and passion out of the process of learning. It makes no sense to become better, because you can't ever reach "world-class" level. This thinking is absolutely toxic. Yet it is there. 

Deep within me I am still stuck. I still compare myself to others in that toxic way. No matter how hard I try not to... I still do it. At least subconciously. And it sucks. 

Comparing myself to others is a problem I still have to solve, if I want to become happy in the long run. I have to remember, that I need to be excelling only when compared to myself the day before. Because that's the only thing that matters. Personal Progress.

As long as I am progressing and giving my all to whatever it is I am doing at that very moment, I can be happy. I can be present, strive to become better, and everything will be alright. I'll be in flow. 

If truly internalized there is simply no point in doing the comparison anymore.
This reminds me a lot of the thoughts expressed in [the Bhagavad Gita](/booknotes/bhagavad-gita).

But still, here I am, living my life, having fun and enjoying most of it, yet I am also there. Not able to follow through with my passions because I want to be better than others. This is ironic and somehow depressing. Maybe this is why I should meditate more often. So that I can find out more about myself. So that I can start to tame and make peace with this screaming voice within my chest, that gets angry at my best friend if we play games together, that makes me go mad when playing basketball and my team is not giving their best and we lose because of it, the thing that makes me assign blame onto others, where probably I am at fault. The thing that makes me smile from the inside at the failing of others because it makes me seem a notch better.

And I am sick of that voice. Even though I know better and thought a lot about it and want to change, it is exceptionally hard to change the psyche to tolerate other people's greatness and be only in competition with myself.

#### Caring about what others think about you




## Summary

There are several things that keep me and probably many others from being the best version of theirselves and I discussed them at great length above. They are: 

- addictions
- not perfect health
- pride, manifested as comparing yourself with others and the fear of failue
- sloth and procrastination
- financial shackles and the need to work for sustenance

All of these can boil down and be solved by a few concepts of ancient wisdom. They are deeply human problems because they are problems of character. The antidote is to build a better character, which is a project that takes a lot of time and work. Ideas on how to do that I are plentiful and you can find them in a lot of books such as [7 Habits](/booknotes/7-habits) or [Enough](/booknotes/enough).

But knowledge is not equal to implementation. And true understanding, true wisdom, only comes when living these ideas day to day. Only when you put in the work to build a solid foundation, a solid character, only then you can overcome these problems.
