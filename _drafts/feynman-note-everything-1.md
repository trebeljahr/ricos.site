While assembling [my needlestack](/needlestack) I noticed a peculiar thing - most of the video content I had spent hours consuming to feed my brain, left almost no trace in my mind. I could roughly give a description of what they were about, but to  remember the detailed, intricate stories and arguments was simply beyond me. This is a huge problem, because it essentially means I have wasted *a lot* of my time watching these things. 

**Problem:** 
We waste time when we consume content for information, if we aren't able to retrieve that information again. 

This article is about an idea of how we can solve this problem and it's going to introduce one particular technique - Feynman Note Taking while doing so. For a more detailed post breaking down this technique to solve the problem - see [Part II](/posts/feynman-note-everything-2). 

## Enter - the Feynman Technique 

Richard Feynman was a famous, nobel prize winning physicist who advocated understanding over rote memorization. He excelled at diving deep into fields foreign to his pursuits in physics and  questioned the heck out of the authoritative views held in those fields. Venturing into biology, biochemistry, drawing, playing bongos or lockpicking with this attitude made him quite the character. You should definitely read his biography [Surely You Are Joking Mr. Feynman](#TODO). I also have [book notes on it](#TODO) if you are interested in my thoughts (btw. book notes for me are a form of Feynman Notes).

So, back to Feynman Notes. When he approached new subjects he didn't know anything about, he would try to understand them on his own terms. This meant that he would try to ditch the common jargon (which are just complicated names for things anyways) and would instead boil down the truly important concepts behind those names into simple words and language. Then he would try to write down those concepts, laying them out on paper, as if trying to write a textbook that explains the topic to a young child. This approach is now known as Feynman Note Taking. 

The main thing that makes taking notes like this effective, is that you have to interact and grapple with the content you are consuming - be that books, lectures, podcasts, videos or even real life conversations. And while you grapple and put it into your words and simplify it for your understanding, you build connections that make these concepts stick in your brain a lot better. You are doing work to anchor things in *your* brain. 

You also expose flaws in understanding you might otherwise gloss over and miss. Which you will feel because everytime you encounter one there will be a bump you hit, almost like a mental block preventing you from writing down what you think you *know*. This will happen every time you encounter parts of a piece of content you don't quite get yet or haven't memorized and internalized yet. 

## The Idea of Feynman Noting Everything

We already established that consuming informational content without understanding it is wasting time. The solution is simple, yet hard. It's to write Feynman style notes on *everything that you consume*. If you watch or read anything for information, and you didn't write Feynman notes for it, chances are you won't  understand and memorize it.

Especially watching videos is something that is not "work". While watching I can shut down my brain and kinda coast along. All the while not actively engaging with what I am "learning". I simply let the content drizzle over me, without  paying attention to it. And the worst part - I can even justify this waste of time to myself because I am "learning" something. Even though the brutal honest truth is that I am not learning anything whatsoever. 

Consuming educational content without grappling with it feels like learning, but it  isn't.

Hence - let's Feynman note everything. 

## Another Advantage

There is another advantage of this process of digesting information - the papertrail you leave behind. Even though note taking has been shown to be better for memory if done by hand instead of on a computer I think that for Feynman Note Taking, doing things on a computer has another advantage. 

Dissecting content this way produces new content. It's kind of like you are constantly producing chewed on and pre-digested, simplified and personalized versions of the content you are consuming. 

You are constantly turning your stream of educational experience into something more worthwhile, through the process of engaging with it in hard mental work. You turn educational experience into a papertrail of Feynman Notes, clarified pieces of text, without jargon and easy to understand and digest. Kind of the perfect blog post.

And you can even share this digital papertrail with others. It makes for good "content" in and of itself. So not only does it help you understand a topic in detail and helps you remember it more clearly, it kind of doubles as a proof of understanding - establishing some amount of authority on a topic you have spent valuable time learning. This is why I think this process should happen on your computer instead of a physical notebook. 

Because this shareable digital papertrail can act as a knowledge portfolio. A portfolio of what you know and how you learned it. The core unit of a knowledge portfolio is the "deep dive" something we'll cover more in [Part II of this series](/posts/feynman-note-everything-2). 

## The Mind

When I think about Feynman Noting everything, something in my mind rebels against it, because my brain can smell the extra cognitive work that this would add. And my brain  doesn't like the thought of extra work. 

I want to lie down in bed, watching videos all day long. I don't want to sit beside my laptop, take notes after watching, *think* about the content I just watched and go over it again. I don't want to disect it, making sure that I understood everything and am able to coherently explain what I watched to others. In short, I don't  want to learn. But yet... I *do*. That's the whole point of watching content like this over a movie or playing video games all day. But when I think about what it would  mean to *sit down* and work through content like this, my mind kinda shrinks away. 

One thing I notice over and over again, is that this feeling in my mind, this sort of aversion towards work is the best indicator I have built in, to what is something good and worthwhile to pursue. [ you know what is the right thing to do, by kind of not wanting to do it](#TODO). Feynman Note taking everything definitely falls into that category.

## Summary

Processing all the content you consume into Feynman Notes to help your understanding and retention is incredibly useful. As you do so, you will produce a papertrail of what you have learned. This papertrail can be shared to prove what you know. In a way, by writing Feynman Notes, you create a "knowledge portfolio". However, doing this is much harder than mindlessly consuming content. And your mind will probably rebel against it.
