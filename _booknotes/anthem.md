> There is evil in your bones for your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brothers. But we cannot change our bones nor our body. 

> We wished to know. We wished to know About all the things which make the earth around us. We asked so many questions the teachers forbade it. 

> And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us seek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It whispers to us that there are great things on this earth or ours, and that we must know them. We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We must know that we may know. 

> We have come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will not bring us to the end of our quest. We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to feel as if with each da our aight were growing sharper than the hawk's and clearer than rock crystal. 

> We do not know, but we shall learn. We cannot stop now, even though it frightens us that we are alone in our knowledge. 

> We have broken the law, but we have never doubted it. Yet now, as we walk the forest, we are learning to doubt. 

> Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars.

> What is my life, if I am but to how, to agree, and to obey?
