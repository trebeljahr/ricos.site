This time this edition is way way late, but I was traveling the last few weeks and didn't find the time to publish on a usual schedule. But on the flipside, a lot has happened and so this edition is quite a bit longer than usual. I will be publishing regularly from now on again.

[**LK-99 is NOT a superconductor üòî** by Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03110.pdf). The community has failed to reproduce the LK-99 room temperature superconductor results. This makes me sad but in a way the results in the first paper were also too good to be true. But what this showed is how the research community can get together and work in overdrive for a while when people get excited. It also showed how the internet (Reddit and Twitter) can play a role in scientific collaboration. And *that* is super cool. The [Wikipedia article on LK-99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99#Experimental_studies) has a comprehensive overview of the different replication efforts and their results + further links, in case you want to read more.

[**Inside the AI Porn Marketplace** by 404Media](https://www.404media.co/inside-the-ai-porn-marketplace-where-everything-and-everyone-is-for-sale/). People already use AI to create NSFW pictures and lots and lots of porn. This article dives into how this came about, where AI porn is distributed and how the economics behind it work and examines the mindset behind the people who create it. It also shines a light on the dilemmas platforms like CivitAI who distribute the models, face and how ‚Äì even though according to their guidelines it's forbidden to generate porn of real life persons ‚Äì people still find ways to bypass the filtering systems and generate it anyway...

[**ASML machine deep dive** by MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/27/1037118/moores-law-computer-chips/). ASML builds the equipment and machines that are critical in the production of transistors at the smallest scales possible. This article dives into the detailed story of the hardships the company had to overcome to solve EUV (extreme ultra violet) chip manufacturing. I learned that the machines ASML builds are engineering and precision marvels. Within them tiny drops of tin get blasted with lasers to produce high intensity bursts of UV light which is then focused with ultra high precision mirrors to etch tiny patterns into silicon. Everything needs to be just perfect, and this puts ASML in a unique position. Nobody can do what they do. If you like the article, there is [also this video on ASML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSVHp6CAyQ8), which is equally fascinating. 

[**Autonomous AI drones are here** by Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/fury/). Anduril is a company that builds automated warfare solutions for the U.S. military. They just released their full autonomy drone named Fury. This adds another machine for automated killing to the companies profile. Killer drones are a real thing already and other weapons utilizing advanced AI systems will follow and soon be deployed in military operations world-wide. To me the freakiest part of all of this is how Anduril has complete [high-budget commercials]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpFFScTovII)) about these things too. 

[**SeamlessM4T (or building a Babelfish)** by MetaAI](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/seamless-communication/). This new model Meta released is simply mindblowing. I mean wtf. They are really building a babelfish... A [babelfish](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1187961-the-babel-fish-is-small-yellow-and-leech-like-and-probably), from the "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" is a fish that can directly translate all languages into the users language when put into the users ear. With models like this one released my Meta we are on the way towards building a device that can mimic such a functionality. The main achievement of this paper is the sheer amount of languages that they support voice and text translations for. Best of all in true Meta fashion it's completely open-source and you [can download the full model from Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication). 

[**Prediction Markets opinion on when weak AGI will be here** by Metaculus**](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/). Prediction markets think that weak AGI will be here around 2027... This is absolute nuts. Think about what this would mean for our society and the shifts we might witness very soon. Just three years ago that was still at 2057... There is also the prediction market [for normal AGI](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/) which puts the date at 2035. I find this graph fascinating because it shows how the developments in the last few years have accelerated the perception of what is possible in the not so distant future. If advances continue to surprise people like this, we might have AGI even sooner than this, which is a truly terrifying prospect.

[**Amazon One ‚Äì Palm scanning technology** by Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/generative-ai-trains-amazon-one-palm-scanning-technology). Generative AI can be used to generate huge amounts of training data for novel problems. In this piece Amazon explains how they used generative AI to build their Amazon One technology. Amazon One can uniquely identify humans by scanning their hands. This can be used to automate payments in physical stores so that smartphones or credit cards are no longer necessary. The technology is already in use in some Amazon stores and is being rolled out to other retailers in the future.
