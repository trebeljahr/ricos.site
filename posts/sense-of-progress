Most people think of progress as a good thing. We want to be better than we were before, we want to push our limits, and we want to invent, create and thrive. We have a sense of progress, and that sense makes us feel good.

I would argue that it makes people inherently happy when they have mastered a skill that they previously did not have. Just take a look at children who learn new things constantly and how they smile and laugh and are excited about their accomplishments.

But, why? Why do we feel good when we are progressing towards becoming better persons? What is the appeal of self-help books? Why do we want to develop a better character? Why are we on this continuous quest to become better than we have been before? And why do we push ourselves to achieve goals at all? Why do we even design our own obstacles to be overcome? Why is excelling in games, like sports, or art or chess important? Why is mastery something valuable?

### Nature...

When thinking of it from an evolutionary point of view it becomes obvious why humans should like the idea of progress and be intrinsically motivated to pursue it. People who were curious and hungry for "more", made their lives considerably better and therefore produced more offspring. They outcompeted people who didn't like progress. Therefore most humans today should value progress. 

### and Nurture...

There is another side attached to this though. Because as always nurture plays a role. The love of progress is not nested equally deep within everyone and I know enough people who do not seem to get the same kick out of learning new stuff and progressing towards goals as other people do. Some people are just more content with what they have, and don't need to move as much.

And I think this has to do with genetic variation, *and* the upbringing of people. Both can change and influence our behaviors and preferences. So the other part that makes us love progression, aside from evolutionary adaptations, is that we probably got pushed by our parents and environment, often from a very early age on. 

I for one was always pushed to be good at things. Pushed might be the wrong word. Encouraged and strengthened in those pursuits with positive reinforcement. That's why I now think that progress is good. And that it is important to excel at learning and achieving goals. Progression was something I always got rewarded for with encouragement and I think that stuck.

So to sum up: 

We like the sense of progression because of both - nature and nurture. 

### Hard Things 

But let's get back to the nature of challenges. The nature of challenge is that hard things are fun for people. 

Because hard things promise our brains rewards and the flood of dopamine when solving a hard thing after a long time of stretching ourselves for a long or very long time might just be one of the best feelings within the realm of human experience. And the thing is that the harder one worked to accomplish something the more subjectively happy this experience will feel. The relief if something worked out after a lot of work. And it feels right when things are done.
 
And when done, there is usually something to show for our efforts. Real things offer something to show for the hard work put into them. There is a social aspect at work here as well, because the fruits of our work, of the challenge, are accepted as a token of personal achievement.
