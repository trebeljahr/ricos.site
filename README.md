# trebeljahr - a blog of a curious person

This is the repository from which the blog at [trebeljahr.com](trebeljahr.com) is being built. The blog is built on Next.js, which generates static webpages from Markdonw, which are then served via Vercel. This allows a blazing fast website hosted for free.
