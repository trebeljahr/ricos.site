[**MiniGPT** by Vision CAIR](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4). An open source implementation of a ChatGPT style model. This one however can also deal with images and describe image content, like OpenAIs GPT-4 promised to be able to do, but isn't yet open to the public. What I find fascinating is that people will soon build things with the same power as GPT-4 but completely open-sourced, and there will be a similar explosion in capabilities, just like it happened when StableDiffusion was open sourced by StabilityAI. I am looking forward to this day. 

[**Software²** by The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/software2-a-new-generation-of-ais-that-become-increasingly-general-by-producing-their-own-training-data/). A long, but worthwhile read on another paradigm shift that will further accelerate the development of AI. Right now, one of the main problems in AI research is the limited amount of training data, that the internet can provide. However big LLTMs can generate infinite amounts of new high quality data. This can then be used to train the next iteration of even bigger LLTMS. And, counterintuitively, this seems to work exceptionally well. Somehow GPT-4 and similar models generalize good enough to synthesize new "insights" often enough, that they can be used to provide data for other algorithms to learn from. This idea of automatic training data enables something else: AIs doing "self-guided" open ended exploration. Determining what next to learn, and then learning that, because the training data will be there to learn it. This way the AI could add new features to itself automatically. And this might get us even closer to true AGI, really soon.

[**Intelligence Superabundance** by NotBoring](https://www.notboring.co/p/intelligence-superabundance). An idea piece arguing that when intelligence "becomes to cheap to meter" people will create more awesome stuff and there will be more work than before, rather than less, because the demand for intelligence is far from saturated. Therefore creating novel and groundbreaking ideas and building them out with AI tooling is something that people will demand more of in the future. The economy that will build around that will support lots of creative jobs, for people trying to build epic products. 

[**What People build on top of AutoGPT** by Jay Scambler](https://twitter.com/JayScambler/status/1645603816111308800). A tweet storm with lots of examples on the crazy things that people build on top of AutoGPT. What is crazy to me is that every week we see new layers on top of the underlying model architecture. GPT => ChatGPT => AutoGPT => another layer of tools sitting on top of that, right now. I wonder for how long this will continue. But the tools people build allow other people to build yet better tools on top of those. Which leads to a cambrian explosion within the tech ecosystem right now.
