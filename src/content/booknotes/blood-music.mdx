## Summary

Greg Bear writes some of the best sci-fi out there, and this is some of his best work. 

<p>{excerpt}</p>

Blood Music is filled with unique ideas. Ideas that make you think about the possibilities of what the future could hold. Just like good SciFi should.

I don't want to spoil anything from the story, so just grab a copy and start reading.
