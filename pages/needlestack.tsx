      <p>
        This is my needlestack, my personal collection of the stuff I treasure
        the most on the internet. The idea is not new and it is not mine either.
        I found it on the blog of Ethan Maurice and loved it soo much that I had
        to make my own list of awesome. The spirit of a page like this reminds
        me a lot of the spirit of githubs awesome project, in other words
        aggregations of awesome stuff on github and the rest of the internet. So
        without further ado - this is mine:
      </p>
      <h2></h2>
    </Layout>
  );
}
