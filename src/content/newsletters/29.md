excerpt: "Welcome to this edition of Live and Learn. The last weeks were an absolute bonanza in terms of things that happened in the world of AI. The White House's Presidents Executive Order, OpenAI's Dev Day, the Github Universe conference, the SnapDragon Summit, RunwayML Gen-2 updates, Luma AIs Genie for text to 3D model generation, an AI automatically negotiating/creating a valid legal contract, xAi releasing their first model Grok and so so much more. Frankly, it's been a bit overwhelming. The pace of development and the direction things are going towards just feel insane. And still, it's only a glimpse of what is yet to come, soon we will live with literal magic at our fingertips. This edition of Live and Learn will be one of the longest ones yet, but I hope you enjoy it anyways."

## ‚ú® Quote ‚ú®

> What an astonishing thing a book is. It‚Äôs a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you‚Äôre inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

[**Hu.ma.ne AI Pin**](https://hu.ma.ne/aipin). The AI Pin by Humane has been released. It's a wearable device that brings the power of AI everywhere you go. Hearing and seeing the world as you see it and providing insights and computation to everything you want to do. The demos are quite wild. Devices like these truly seem like magic. People who wear something like this, become wizards in a way, able to seamlessly access and utilize information to deal with their surroundings more efficiently. Moving the power of AI into the background, always there to help people live their lives more meaningful, to understand the world and access ideas and information about everything they can interact with. There is a TED talk, released about 6 months ago about this same product that is [worth watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ) and now one can actually buy this product. I wonder where computing devices and platforms like this will go next and what kind of wizardry we will be able to use in the not so distant future. We truly live in exciting times. 

[**Github Universe Developer Conference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQkdDVupQE&list=PL0lo9MOBetEGF_pCQVCc_3z36ihKSolLC&index=1). The whole event was epic in terms of scale of the announcements and quality of the presentations and I suggest watching more of it than just the Keynote. Some of the coolest include [the role of AI in safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvUMWug_iLU), and how Github [is using AI to enhance internal developer productivity at scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hleHx2Uiqmo). To me, the craziest announcement was that of Github Workspaces, which will enable the semi-automatic resolution of issues opened in Github. Somebody has a problem with a repo, and the AI understands enough context + the problem description to automatically generate a step by step plan to address the issue and even open a PR with suggested fixes. This seems like magic now, but will be the reality within the next few years. 

[**Snapdragon Summit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_vh7_n_OPs). All of the AI workloads and generative AI breakthroughs need compute to enable them to be run on our devices and make experiences like virtual reality on Metas Quest 3 possible. And hte company behind that, Qualcomm, is producing new chips that can power the compute necessary to do this. Making it possible to run generative AI models like Stable Diffusion on high end smartphones in sub second times. As well as building chips that *outperform* the M2 max apple chips both in terms of raw compute as well as power efficiency. This is simply nuts. And to me this all of this is exciting, to be able to see how all these pieces fit together and how the whole industry, both on the software and hardware sides comes together to build literal, real life magic. How with the innovation of all these companies, we are going towards a future where computation and artificial intelligence is deeply woven into the fabric of our society. Many of these keynotes and announcements seem like science fiction now, the only difference is that, well... they aren't science fiction, they are real products, real breakthroughs, real technology that exists *right now*. 

[**OpenAI DevDay**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk). This Developer Conference eclipsed all of the other things that have happened in the last few weeks. OpenAI absolutely killed it with their announcements and they are making ChatGPT better at such a rapid pace that it feels *unreal*. I am still wrapping my head about how ChatGPT just came out last year around the same time. And now it is multimodal, can access up to date information, browse the web, execute code, interact with files, generate images, has a 128k context window, can be customized into "GPT" agents, is integratable into existing products as an assistant, can understand and call your own code to build crazy new experiences *and* has gotten much cheaper and faster to run?! Within a *year*. It's worth reading the announcements [like the introduction of GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) and their [new products](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday) in OpenAIs own words. Their progress has been insane, and as with many other updates recently: Meta, Snapdragon, Github... Satya Nadella and Microsoft play a role in empowering these companies. It's wild to see.

[**Presidential Executive Order on Safe AI Development**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/). It seems like the regulatory apparatus of the United States is kicking into gear trying to control and safeguard the development of AI, trying to increase the chances that these developments are "good". There is a solid summary on what all of this means on the [HAI blog of the Stanford University](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/decoding-white-house-ai-executive-orders-achievements), that is worth reading. As well as an [official "fact sheet"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/) released by the White House itself that gives a short summary of what the executive order is trying to do. 

[**Gen-2 Updates** by RunwayML](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1720064304374792615). Runway's Gen-2 is an AI for creating short video clips. Kind of like Midjourney or Dalle but for videos instead of images. Now it has gotten an update that massively increased the quality of it's output and people have gone crazy over how much of a stepup it has been. I think soon we can generate entire movies without ever touching a camera by using Runway Gen-x or some model like it and that idea makes me excited. 

[**Text to 3D** by LumaAI](https://lumalabs.ai/genie). You have to sign up on discord to use the research preview of the model but I think it's worth it. It's another magical moment, just like when Midjourney got first released... even though this still feels like a toy right now, and is janky and has it's edges and is not *that* useful right now... it is the worst it'll ever be right now, from here on it'll only get better and that means that pretty soon we will have production ready 3D models entirely generated by a text prompt, enabling game creators and movie CGI artists to go completely crazy with these things since they won't have to learn the hard skill of modelling 3D objects anymore. They can simply generate them on the fly with a tool like this. 

[**First Legal Contract Without Human Involvement** by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/07/ai-negotiates-legal-contract-without-humans-involved-for-first-time.html). In this article CNBC is describing how a company by the name of [Luminance](https://www.luminance.com/) is creating and selling AI tools to automate parts of the legal workflow, aiming to make the life of lawyers easier as well as to ultimately sell to companies directly so they can do more legal work with less lawyers. Luminance has now, for the first time *ever* used an AI to completely generate a valid contract from scratch. Luminances AI can analyse and negotiate contracts, and help lawyers do their work, much like Githubs Copilot is helping developers to code. They boast to be able save 90% of the time lawyers spend for big companies, through the automatic generation, analysis, rephrasing and negotiation of contracts.

[**Make Real App** by tldraw](https://makereal.tldraw.com/). This webapp is essentially a whiteboard for sketching out UI/website ideas with a magical *make real button* powered by GPT-4 that turns the sketch into a real working website including JS, CSS, HTML code and all. This stuff is absolutely nuts and the demos of people using this tool are insane. Just look at [this](https://twitter.com/liuyuxxd/status/1725331464802447405), or [this](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1725476534754910275), or [this](https://twitter.com/dubenko_/status/1725178991928094777), or [this](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1725298483320828152). Or simply browse through the [tldraw X account](https://twitter.com/tldraw) to see more crazy examples of people mentioning the tool... things like this are magic but will become commonplace soon. 

[**AI Progress/Announcements in November** by @nickfloats](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1724757425319026949). Finally, just to see what it means for technology to go exponential just look at this tweet to see how crazy things are... this is one month of announcements and it's not even comprehensive, missing many of the things I put into this newsletter.
