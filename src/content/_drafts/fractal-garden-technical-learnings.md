Design, and how much I suck at it. Luckily there is lawsofux and I just copied some of their design because it looks so good. 

A lot of work is rework. You do something, then you find out, hmm, I should do it this way instead, because I really want feature X, or run into a bug that was unanticipated. For this particular project of the Fractal Garden two big things and refactors come to my mind.
