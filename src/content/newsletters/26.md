> You will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world then of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.

[**ChatGPT can now see hear and speak** by Open AI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak). ChatGPT got much better, in what kind of feels like overnight. It can now hear, see, and speak. In other words, you can input images and voice prompts into ChatGPT, and it will happily answer you with a human-like voice. This makes it even more accessible than before. The image mode especially is ridiculously good at helping with tasks that ChatGPT previously couldn't handle because they required visual input. I am stoked and look forward to how this combines with the Dalle‚Äì3 integration, once I have access to it.

[**Meta Connect**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJu9VyIw64). I like watching keynotes like this one tremendously. To me, the coolest announcement of the whole show was that of good and [affordable AR glasses for as little as $299 USD](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/wayfarer-shiny-black-plano-g15-green/). Stuff like this reminds me of the fact that we are living in the future. Technological progress is accelerating every year and watching keynotes lets me viscerally *feel* that. Every year mindblowing stuff happens, and we get to know about it. And it doesn't matter to me whether it's from Meta, Google, Nvidia, or somebody else. It gets me excited about what is yet to come and I like that feeling of excitement.

[**Array Labs 3D Mapping Earth from Space** by Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/p/array-labs-3d-mapping-earth-from). In this piece, Packy McCormick dives into the details of a company that has the bold plan to create a high-resolution 3D map of the Earth. The main takeaway is this: if they can pull it off, the company is going to be very very successful. However, they need to solve extreme technical challenges but are building the teams and the technology to do exactly that. Having a 3D map of the Earth with 10 cm per pixel resolution would enable *a lot* of cool stuff. Data provided by Array Labs could become a platform for people to build amazing stuff on. Think AR, self-driving cars... and military spy operations. 

[**Metaverse Interview with Mark Zuckerberg** by Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg). WTF. Not only is this a good interview in true Lex Fridman style but a first of its kind. The whole interview was conducted in the Metaverse with digital avatars that look and *feel* like humans. Even just watching the video is crazy because it's like watching Lex Fridman and Mark Zuckerberg having a real conversation. What would this sort of technology feel like if one actually was wearing proper VR/AR headsets? I think soon many of us will be able to find out. Also, I highly recommend reading the comment section of this video, it‚Äôs hilarious. 

[**The Chemical Code** by Enveda](https://www.enveda.com/posts/the-chemical-code-opportunity). We know a lot about the genetic code, but that doesn't mean that we know how cells *really* work. Because to do that we would need to know about the chemistry going on *inside of cells*. Turns out we pretty much don't understand or even really know about 95% of the chemistry that is happening right within us. And that is obviously bad. This piece dives into the ideas of how we can do better than this and how Enveda Biosciences is executing these ideas right now to create a new kind of drug discovery platform.
