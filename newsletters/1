# Newsletter #1

This is my first newsletter, *ever*. The idea of this newsletter is to send 1 photo (above), 1+ booknote(s), 1+ post(s), 1 status update, 1 song and 1 useful/beautiful/random link. So here we go:

## Booknotes
This month I've read and published booknotes on: 
- [High Output Management - Andrew Grove](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/high-output-management)
- [Being You - Anil Seth](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/being-you)
- [Navalmanack - Naval Ravikant](https://trebeljahr.com/booknotes/navalmanack).

## Posts
I loved: [Let's talk about Margins](https://craigmod.com/essays/lets_talk_about_margins/) by Craig Mod. Beautifully written – a post about the attention to detail – and the feeling of "good paper". 
This moved me.

I wrote: [Morning Meditation](https://trebeljahr.com/posts/morning-meditation). A post about enjoying the beauty of early autumn mornings in Berlin. 

## Status Update
For most of this month, I've been working on [www.fractal.garden](https://www.fractal.garden). It's been a wild month but the site is slowly coming to fruition (excuse the pun). If looking at beautiful fractal patterns is your thing, then you should 100% check it out!

Roughly 1 week of this month was spent creating this very newsletter and the capabilities to deliver more in the future. I am working on creating a write-up of how I built everything and all the technology behind the effort. Stay tuned!

## Song
Timber Hearth by Andrew Prahlow, from the "Outer Wilds" Soundtrack:
 
- [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=SPa8bPqQfmo&feature=share)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BIf974vl0lIEo3EY1XvD1)

## Link
I discovered one of my favorite sites on the internet this month. 
- [Sketchplanations by Jono Hey](https://sketchplanations.com/)

Now I want to buy half of them as prints, simply because they are so beautiful.
