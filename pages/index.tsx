      <p>
        I am Rico. A programmer, traveler, photographer, writer and fellow
        human. This is my personal website. It will be filled with lots of
        different things. But is <em>currently</em> still under construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is where I want to collect thoughts, booknotes, quotes, ideas,
        useful links to my favorite places in the internet, traveling stories,
        photography and my side projects. For now I still have an old - second
        site - over at{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://ricotrebeljahr.com">
          ricotrebeljahr.com
        </ExternalLink>{" "}
        but the content will eventually also move over here.
      </p>
      <TrySomeOfThese />
      <p>
        If you want to know what I am doing now, head over to{" "}
        <Link as={`/now`} href="/now">
          <a>/now</a>
        </Link>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also find me on other places around the internet, like{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.instagram.com/ricotrebeljahr/">
          Instagram
        </ExternalLink>
        ,{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/trebeljahr">Github</ExternalLink>
        ,{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trebeljahr">
          LinkedIn
        </ExternalLink>{" "}
        or{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/ricotrebeljahr">
          Twitter
        </ExternalLink>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also used to write a travel blog with a friend of mine, which you can
        still find at{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://photodyssee.com">
          photodyssee.com
