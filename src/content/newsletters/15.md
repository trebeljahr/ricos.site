[**Segment Anything** by Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/segment-anything-foundation-model-image-segmentation/). Segmentation is the task of finding the objects in an image and then making this identification usable for the computer. Which part of the image shows what, where are the edges of things, etc? This crazy model released by Meta is very very good at this task of segmentation. Like the title of the paper suggests it can segment *anything*. This is huge, especially for augmented reality purposes which is why Meta puts a lot of effort into researching these things. The paper even shows how much easier a model like this makes designing AR overlays, and how the team focused on this aspect of the model.

[**Wolverine** by BioBootLoader](https://github.com/biobootloader/wolverine). A GitHub repo for a Python interpreter, where the code fixes its own bugs while running continuously. WTF. You write code, with bugs, but all the error messages get routed into GPT-4 together with the code you wrote, then GPT-4 adjusts the code to fix the errors and re-runs it, finds the remaining errors, fixes them, again and again until there are no errors left. It is, essentially, an automatic debugger. Hooking this up to a test suite will enable an extreme version of test driven development. Define what you want as a bunch of test cases, and let GPT-4 figure out the rest, recursively, until the program passes all your test cases.

[**Software 3.0** by Divyansh Garg](https://divgarg.substack.com/p/software-3). This is the logical next step after [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35), a famous idea by Andrej Karpathy. Instead of building your own, you use *already existing* models to build software systems using only plain English. Put in the requirements, and get out the finished product. And with tools like the above this vision of Software 3.0 is already here. Soon everybody can build arbitrarily complex software, without knowing about any of the lower-level details. Just as people don't need to know Assembly to write complex websites, Android apps, or 3D games, people in the future won't need to know the syntax of programming languages or APIs and similar paradigms anymore. We will be able to transcend those concepts and work in yet another layer of abstraction. 

[**Planning for AGI and Beyond** by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond). It's really interesting to see that OpenAI puts a lot of thought into what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they think the world is going to change because of their actions. Their mission statement is wonderful: "Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence‚ÄîAI systems that are generally smarter than humans‚Äîbenefits all of humanity." This post dives into what that means, and what to do once we get there. On the same topic, there is a [way longer Lex Fridman interview](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rAOusZcsuNtCv8mefmwND) with Sam Altman, one of the co-founders of OpenAI. It is an interesting back-and-forth conversation, teasing out the philosophy of this company and its founder.
